25/05/2017 - mIRC v7.49

Changes:
1.Changed CAP invite-notify support so that invite notifications are now
  displayed by default.
2.Added CAP 3.2 support, so mIRC now sends LS CAP 302 when logging on.
3.Added CAP cap-notify support which allows a server to add or remove
  capabilities during a connection. mIRC responds to NEW or DEL events
  by quitting and reconecting, as allowed by the specification.
4.Added server version check for UnrealIRCd in order to disable support
  for mode +q quiet lists as UnrealIRCd uses mode +q for owner lists.
5.Changed Add/Edit server dialog to allow use of seperate server and
  logon method passwords.
6.Changed /server -w and -l switches to allow specification of separate
  [-w password] for server and [-l method password] for logon method.
7.Changed $server().pass to return server password and .methodpass to
  return logon method password.
8.Fixed window treebar/switchbar focus bug.
9.Fixed $regmlex() returning 0 for empty capture group when it should
  have been returning $null.
10.Fixed CAP SASL external bug.
11.Added CTCP DCC resume error message when file is smaller than the
   existing file.
12.Added support for evaluation of highlight tip messages.
13.Added /sockopen -n switch to disable Nagle algorithm on socket.
14.Fixed IAL gpf bug when IAL was turned off and channel was joined.

15/04/2017 - mIRC v7.48

Changes:
1.Extended $com() to handle one dimensional single-byte array results
  which are now copied into the specified &binvar.
2.Fixed $com() memory bug that resulted in memory not being freed after
  a dispatch pointer request.
3.Fixed on RAWMODE not triggering for invalid mode changes such as
  a channel mode change for a user that is not on the channel.
4.Fixed /dns bug that returned IP address instead of error if it was
  unable to reverse lookup IP address.
5.Added sha256 fingerprint to server SSL certificate dialog.
6.Extended /dns to parse nick!user@host and extract the host for
  resolution.
7.Added -nowine command line option to disable Wine support for testing
  purposes.
8.Fixed custom dialog incorrect client size bug due to menubar height.
9.Fixed $insong/$inmidi/$inwave bugs with appended text.
10.Fixed if/while statement parsing bug.
11.Updated to OpenSSL 1.0.2k library.
12.Added "Control key enables mark/copy" option to Options/Other/Keys
   dialog.
13.Added support for middle-click mouse button to close tab in
   switchbar/treebar.
14.Added SASL/NickServ support as a per server setting in the servers
   dialog. SASL is supported using CAP. NickServ is supported by
   logging in when numeric 001 is received.
15.Added /server -l method parameter where method can be: pass, sasl,
   external, msg, nickserv.
16.Added $server().method property to return server login method.
17.Added CAP support for extended-join and account-notify. These are
   enabled automatically on connect if available and provide the account
   names of users in JOIN/ACCOUNT events. ACCOUNT events are not shown
   but are used to update $ial().account. They trigger as RAW events.
18.Added CAP support for away-notify. This is automatically enabled if
   available and makes the server send AWAY events to the client
   indicating the away state of users on the same channels as you. AWAY
   events are not shown but are used to set $ial().away. They trigger as
   RAW events.
19.Added CAP support for account-tag. This is automatically enabled if
   available and makes the server include the user's @acount=name in the
   message-tag for messages sent by that user.
20.Added CAP support for invite-notify. This is automatically enabled if
   available and makes the server send these events to the client for
   users invited to their channel. These events are not shown but
   trigger as RAW events.
21.Added CAP support for chghost. This is automatically enabled if
   available and makes the server send user@host updates for nicknames
   on the same channels to update the IAL. These events are not shown
   but trigger as RAW events.
22.Added /ialfill #channel command that fills the IAL by sending a /WHO
   #channel to the server and processing the WHO reply. If the server
   supports WHOX, an extended /WHO #channel %acdfhlnrstu,T is sent
   to receive the account name, where T is a number that uniquely
   identifies the WHO request and is set to 995.
23.Extended mark/copy to allow copying a single character by initially
   marking more than one character.
24.Fixed file change monitor bug that was causing timers to be blocked
   while the file change dialog was displayed.
25.Added $ial().gecos to return gecos/name field from the /who reply.
26.Added $ial().id that is a unique id number for each new entry in
   the IAL.
27.Extended /ialmark to allow setting arbitrary marks using the format:

   /ialmark -nrw <nick> [name] [text]

   -n = the [name] of the mark. If -n is not used, the default name
   'default' is used.
   -r = remove the mark
   -w = used with -rn to treat name as wildcard

   Marks can be accessed using $ialmark(nick,N/name) and properties
   'name' and 'mark'.

28.Optimized $ial() when looking up nick!user@host where the nick
   contains no wildcards. An instant hash lookup on the nick is now
   performed and a full address match performed on the result, instead
   of a slower wildcard/address search.
29.Added $dqwindow identifier that returns the state of the single
   message window. When used in on TEXT/ACTION events, it also returns
   opening/writing/written states.

   echo State: $iif($dqwindow & 1,enabled,not enabled)
   echo State: $iif($dqwindow & 2,open,not open)
   echo State: $iif($dqwindow & 4,opening,not opening)
   echo State: $iif($dqwindow & 8,writing,not writing)
   echo State: $iif($dqwindow & 16,written,not written)

30.Fixed server password not being encoded in mirc.ini/servers.ini
   in some situations.
31.Changed server group to be truncated at ,'":; and space character
   for future extension of servers.ini format.
32.Added -a switch to all binary variable commands that makes them not
   apply UTF-8 encoding to characters in the range 0-255, as long as
   the line contains no characters > 255.
33.Added channel central support for +q quiet list channel mode
   supported by some networks. Also added $chan().iql, $iql(), and
   isquiet.

   Note: the quiet list numerics and their format vary across IRC
   networks: some use 728 and 729, others use 344 and 345, some use a
   'q' parameter, other do not. Also, some networks use these numerics
   for other events, eg. 345 for invites and 729 for whois. mIRC has to
   perform parameter checks on these numerics to decide what they mean
   on a server.

34.Extended numeric 334 support for networks that use it as part of a
   whois reply that provides the user's location. This numeric is also
   used as a list/command syntax reply on other networks.
35.Fixed WM_ENDSESSION handling bug that resulted in mIRC being closed
   by Windows before it could save all settings.
36.Fixed group changes via enable/disable commands not being saved if
   used during the on UNLOAD event.
37.Improved /who tracking method.
38.Extended $regsub() to support output to a &binvar.
39.Extended $regsubex() to support output to a %var|&binvar, and to
   return N, as long as the name parameter is specified.
40.Extended /ban to support -beIq switches. These can be stacked but are
   issued as separate modes.
41.Extended per network channel key history that remembers keys of
   joined channels for the current mIRC session. Now used automatically
   in more joins eg. after reconnect, in new server windows, and so on.
   History is cleared with "Channels" in the Clear History dialog.
42.Fixed window focus not being set correctly when a custom dialog is
   used to open/close custom windows.
43.Changed the way sound-related routines are called by all features
   to make it easier to change away from MCI.
44.Changed sound-related routines to use DirectSound instead of MCI to
   play sounds.
45.Added "Create new certificate" button to Options/IRC/SSL dialog that
   creates a new self-signed client certificate, saves the key/cert
   pair to a PEM file, and sets it as your private key.
46.Added $sslcertsha1 and $sslcertsha256 identifiers that return
   fingerprint of currently loaded SSL client certificate file for use
   with /nickserv cert add.
47.Optimized the channel central +beIq lookup routines.
48.Extended /timer -pr switches to support wildcards.
49.Fixed $sound().vbr bug.
50.Added /drawsize @ <w h> that sets the bitmap size for picture windows
   up to a maximum of 8192 x 8192 pixels. Note: 1) a bitmap cannot be
   sized to less than the largest point that has been drawn on it (which
   can be reset with /clear), 2) once a size has been set, changing the
   window size will not resize it to less than the set size.
51.Fixed /drawreplace not setting largest point drawn to correctly.

5.Reverted changes to $calc() and other identifiers regarding number of
  decimal digits in floating point calculations.
6.Updated About dialog to use Windows theme.
7.Changed op/ignore/protect/voice commands to maintain position of item
  in list if it already exists. Same applies to editing item in the
  Control dialog.
8.Extended hotlink and catcher to allow underscores in addresses.
9.Updated to TagLib 1.11.1 library.
10.Updated CA root certificates cacert.pem file.
11.Fixed /protect not using network parameter correctly.
12.Fixed $modespl not allowing larger server-set values.
13.Fixed $int() bug when rounding some negative values.
14.Fixed $com().result not trimming trailing zeros in float values.
15.Fixed $wrap() not updating wrapped text if case has changed.
16.Fixed hash table bug that resulted in intermittent gpfs due to
   incorrect freeing of memory in some contexts.

01/08/2016 - mIRC v7.46

Changes:
1.Updated to OpenSSL 1.0.2h library.
2.Fixed /timer -h high resolution timer which was being limited to the
  same rate as the -m millisecond timer.
3.Added $samepath(path1,path2) identifier that returns $true/$false
  if paths refer to the same file/dir. It resolves relative paths and
  converts long/short filenames.
4.Added /copy -f switch to flush copy to disk immediately.
5.Added /rename -f switch to flush rename to disk immediately and -o
  switch to allow overwrite of an existing file.
6.Extended $calc() and other identifiers to return up to 12 decimal
  digits in floating point calculations.
7.Added $tempfn identifier that returns temporary filename located in
  mIRC folder using same method that mIRC uses internally.
8.Fixed Clear History bug that incorrectly cleared channels list
  settings while status window was connected to a server.
9.Extended /mkdir to create the full path to the target folder.
10.Changed the way files are replaced during updates to decrease the
  potential for file loss eg. lost mirc.ini files in situations such
  as gpfs, BSODs, and power failures.
11.Changed URL catcher to extract URLs using the same method used by
   hotlink feature.
12.Extended URL hotlink/extract feature to handle IPv6 addresses.
13.Fixed $base() bug with floating point precision.
14.Fixed /hadd not reporting error if UTF-8 conversion results in a
   string that is too long.
15.Fixed script error not showing line number for single-line event
   definitions.
16.Added /list -n switch to minimize channels list window.
17.Added resize grip to bottom right of resizable dialogs: channel
   central, channel folder, play central, and scripts editor.
18.Fixed regex bug when \K is used in some regex patterns, such as
   $regsubex(abcd, /.\K/g, <>).
19.Fixed /drawline -p bug when measuring clipping width for text that
   contains tab characters.
20.Updated to PCRE 8.39 library.

  tip and possibly other contexts.
8.Fixed tray tips and speech bug in formatting of text for mode event
  that contains multiple mode changes.
9.Updated CA root certificates cacert.pem file.

25/03/2016 - mIRC v7.44

Changes:
1.Fixed incorrectly formatted else/elseif reporting the wrong error.
2.Changed /fwrite -n to allow writing an empty line.
3.Updated manifest files to indicate Windows 10 compatibility.
4.Extended $os identifier to detect Windows 10.
5.Added support for extended numeric 338 reply with IPv6 address.
6.Fixed $encode($null,m) returning "line too long" error.
7.Added $regml().group property that returns the () group number for
  a match and .match property that returns the match number in the
  case of a /g global match that returns multiple matches.
8.Added /sockopen -46 switches to specify the IPv4/IPv6 context when
  resolving named addresses.
9.Extended /sockopen to base its IPv4/IPv6 context on the bind address
  if specified and if the -46 switches are not used.
10.Changed /server to base its IPv4/IPv6 context on the IP address if
   one is used.
11.Added $isalias() property .ftype and now allows listing of lines in
   multi-line aliases using $isalias(alias,N).alias.
12.Fixed $msgtags not being reset immediately after an event.
13.Fixed $eval() bug that caused over-evaluation in some cases.
14.Fixed logging bug with large log files.
15.Fixed log view dialog file size bug with large log files.
16.Extended $com() to allow passing parameters in from and results out
   to binary variables. To pass parameters in from binary variables,
   prefix the variable type with & to indicate the parameter is a binary
   variable eg. $com(name, member, method, &bstr, &binvar). To retrieve
   a result into a binary variable, use $com(name, &binvar).result.
17.Updated to OpenSSL 1.0.2g library.
18.Extended $sysdir() to support downloads folder.
19.Updated to PCRE 8.38 library.
20.Added CA root certificates cacert.pem file to installer. On a new
   install, mIRC will default to using this as the trusted authorities
   file if found in the mIRC folder.
21.Fixed $findfile()/$finddir() not responding to Control+Break.
22.Added regex modifier 'u' which enables PCRE_UTF8 and PCRE_UCP in the
   same way as PHP.
23.Fixed CAP bug that caused mIRC not to parse the capabilities list if
   it was not prefixed by a : colon.
24.Updated code signing certificate to SHA-256. Binaries are now dual
   code-signed with SHA-1 and SHA-256.
25.Updated to TagLib 1.11 library.
26.Extended $regex() to allow unlimited backreferences.
27.Added $file().version to return file version of executable/DLL.
28.Extended $bvar(&binvar) to return name if &binvar exists.
29.Added $font(N/name) identifier with properties .size, .pitch, and
   .type.
30.Added command warning dialog that warns new users when they enter a
   scripting command into an editbox. The option is enabled by default
   and can be enabled/disabled in the Options/Other/Confirm dialog.
31.Added $unsafe(text) identifier for use with, for example, user input
   in /timer commands, that delays evaluation of text for one level of
   evaluation.
32.Moved send file dialog options, such as packet size, to DCC Options
   dialog.
33.Updated all file dialogs, including the send file dialog, to use
   modern file dialogs.
34.Updated to NSIS 2.50 installer and related plugins.
35.Fixed mode +q event being processed as on OWNER/DEOWNER event on
   networks that use +q as a channel mode.
36.Fixed numeric 353 and 366 bug that caused them to trigger the raw
   event even if raw was disabled.
37.Fixed if/while bracket parsing bug that caused mIRC to freeze with
   a certain combination of separators and brackets.
38.Added /write -mN switch, where N = 0 is the default behaviour, N = 1
   adds CRLF to end of file if not already there before writing a line,
   and N = 2 never adds CRLF to end of file before writing a line.
39.Added check for servers that include MONITOR in numeric 005 but do
   not actually support it. mIRC reverts back to ISON in this case.
40.Fixed on UNLOAD event not being triggered when a file is deleted
   via the Script Editor File/Delete menu item.
41.Fixed treebar expand/collapse bug that was causing treebar not to
   update correctly.
42.Fixed dcc chat window beep on incoming text not paying attention to
   the "Enable Sounds" option in the options dialog.
43.Fixed active "A" letter not appearing on tray icon for the active
   mIRC when more than one mIRC is running.
44.Updated installer so that, if installing as non-portable, it writes
   to the registry to set mIRC as an IRC protocol handler and to make
   mIRC appear in the default programs list. mIRC also does this itself
   on startup if run as non-portable and as an administrator. On Windows
   8 onwards, administrator access is not required for this to work.
45.Added installer /NOADMIN switch to allow running installer without
   administrator access.
46.Updated installer to remove legacy code that was needed for older
   Windows versions.
47.Added "Certficate" menu item to status window system menu that
   allows viewing of the SSL certificate for an SSL connection.
48.Changed /exit -r to no longer restart mIRC using a short filename,
   which had been necessary under older Windows versions.
49.Changed SSL certificate warning dialog to center based on the status
   window position as opposed to the mIRC window.
50.Changed various dialogs to center in the middle of the MDI window
   if the top MDI window is zoomed.
51.Fixed SSL memory leak that caused small amounts of memory not to
   be freed during initial connection.
52.Added regex modifier 'F' that makes \N back-references in patterns
   and N indexes in identifiers refer to the () capture group order. It
   also causes $regml() to include empty () matches. This makes the
   regex feature work like standard regex. Help file has been updated to
   include these details.
53.Added $regmlex(name,M,N) where M is the match number (in case of
   multiple /g global matches) and N is the () group number. If N is not
   specified, it defaults to 1.
54.Extended $url to work with browsers that do not support DDE, like
   Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome.

03/08/2015 - mIRC v7.43

Changes:
1.Fixed window focus bug that affected switching windows when using
  control+tab, the switchbar, and other methods.
2.Added $sysdir(item) to return system folders for the current user
  where item can be profile, desktop, documents, music, pictures,
  and videos.

17/07/2015 - mIRC v7.42

Changes:
1.Fixed tokenization bug due to strtok()'s use of an internal static
  varible that may have caused a number of subtle bugs. Replaced with
  more secure strtok_s().
2.Fixed script error line number bug that was causing the line
  number not to be reported in some contexts.
3.Fixed /drawtext -c clipping bug.
4.Added /filter -hN switch that indents wrapped text when the -p
  switch is used.
5.Fixed channel central listbox horizontal scrollbar bug that caused
  the ends of lines to be chopped.
6.Updated libraries to OpenSSL 1.0.1p.
7.Fixed SSL certificate change warning bug that caused warnings to be
  displayed for valid certificates.
8.Fixed /filter output to nul not working.
9.Updated voice command support to work with newer versions of Windows.
10.Extended /server to handle passwords with spaces.
11.Updated libraries to PCRE v8.37.
12.Changed drag-drop to only set focus on a window once a file has been
   dropped onto it and before commands are executed.
13.Fixed /play dialog not allowing long filenames to be typed into
   filename editbox.
14.Fixed file dialog bug that prevented typing a folder name into the
   filename editbox to change into that folder.
15.Changed script processing method so that Windows no longer thinks
   mIRC has stopped responding during long loops.
16.Extended /savebuf -l to work with channel nicklist.
17.Fixed /exit bug that caused settings to be saved incorrectly when
   used in some contexts.
18.Fixed $input() bug that caused mIRC to gpf if the script it was
   running from was modified while waiting for input.
19.Fixed $encode(..., 0) and $decode(..., 0) not returning correct
   line count.
20.Added $encode()/$decode() 'a' switch for base32 encoding.
21.Fixed $encode() bug that caused a gpf with input whose encoded
   output was longer than maximum line length, now triggers "line too
   long" error.
22.Added $sha256(), $sha384() and $sha512() identifiers, same format
   as $sha1().
23.Added $hmac(text|&binvar|filename, key, hash, N) identifier where
   hash = md5, sha1 (default), sha256, sha384, or sha512, and N = 0
   for plain text (default), 1 for &binvar, 2 for filename.
24.Added $hotp(key, count, hash, digits) identifier and
   $totp(key, time, hash, digits, timestep) identifiers.

   The key can be in a hex format of 40/64/128 chars, base32 format
   of 16/24/32 chars, or plain text. It can also be in a Google
   Authenticator format ie. lowercase with spaces.

   For $hotp: count is required, hash and digits are optional and
   default to sha1 and 6.

   For $totp: time, hash, digits, and timestep are optional and
   default to $ctime, sha1, 6, and 30.

25.Fixed $sdir() not being centered correctly after you resize the
   dialog.
26.Added support for IRCv3 message tags. mIRC will now automatically
   remove @ prefixed tags from incoming server messages and store
   them in the $msgtags identifier. The CAP server-time "time" tag
   can now be parsed when mixed with other tags.
27.Fixed treebar not setting active item when maximized windows are
   hidden and then shown again.
28.Added $msgtags(tag|N) identifier with .tag .key properties, where
   N = 0 returns number of tags.
29.Added on PARSELINE event, triggers before incoming/outgoing server
   lines are received/sent and allows a script to modify them.

   on *:PARSELINE:<in|out|*>:matchtext:echo $parsetype $parseline

   The line can be modified using the following command:

   /parseline -iotbqpnuN [text|&binvar]

   -i or -o = required to specify an in/out line.

   -t or -b = required to specify text or &binvar.

   -q = add a new line to the end of the in/out queue. It can be used
   inside and outside the PARSELINE event. New lines are processed
   after the script/event exits.

   -p = use with -q to indicate that the new line should trigger the
   PARSELINE event.

   -n = add a CRLF to the end of the line if it does not have one.

   -uN = where N is 0 or 1 and either disables or enables UTF-8
   encoding/decoding for the line.

   Notes:

   1) A script must check $parseutf to know whether mIRC will be UTF-8
   encoding/decoding a line. For outgoing lines, if $parseutf is $true,
   after the PARSELINE event, mIRC will UTF-8 encode the line before
   sending it to the server. You can prevent this by using -u0. For
   incoming lines, if $parseutf is $true, after the PARSELINE event,
   mIRC will UTF-8 decode the line before processing it. You can prevent
   this by using -u0.

   2) This feature should only be used, for example, to support features
   and/or protocols that mIRC does not already support, not to modify
   standard lines. mIRC maintains internal states based on incoming and
   outgoing lines. If lines are modified, mIRC may not work correctly. 

30.Fixed Options/Sounds Event Beeps beep value not being applied,
   resulting in repeated beeping during a flash event.
31.Extended script editor editbox limit to 1MB.
32.Fixed $intersect() bug that was rounding floating point values.

28/02/2015 - mIRC v7.41

Changes:
1.Added $calc() // floor divide operator.
2.Optimized script parser recursion to make better use of reserved
  stack space, enabling slightly deeper recursion.
3.Optimized SSL event processing speed.
4.Fixed $input() maximum editbox limit being off by one.
5.Extended hotlinks to correctly parse channel names in a channel
  message/notice prefix format.
6.Fixed file handling bug that would have caused mirc.ini to be reset
  if there was a drive error, such as the drive being full.
7.Fixed another while loop bug.
8.Fixed MDI window transparency bug under Windows 8.
9.Extended SSL support to allow connecting to SNI servers.

28/01/2015 - mIRC v7.39

Changes:
1.Extended /dll -u to allow use of a partial path.
2.Reverted Channels List window change so that modes are included in
  the listing again.
3.Fixed hash table bug that would have caused a gpf if mIRC was
  unable to allocate memory for the table.
4.Fixed INI file bug where mIRC was not unloading an INI file if it
  no longer existed, ie. when deleted by another application.
5.Added $comchar identifier to return the command prefix character.
6.Fixed connection timeout not being applied while a STARTTLS handshake
  is in progress.
7.Fixed script editor bug that caused popups text not to be displayed

  to return environment variables.
2.Added $notify identifier, returns $true or $false based on whether
  the notify list is enabled or disabled.

  not be in some situations.
4.Updated the default DCC accept and ignore file types lists.
5.Extended /close -@ to handle @N window id values.

  auto-expand incorrectly for large numbers of windows.
7.Fixed DCC Get/Fserve not using path of existing DCC Get window when
  resuming a failed transfer.
8.Fixed DCC Get window not being updated when a resume begins in some
  cases.
9.Fixed DCC Fserve get not applying "sort files by nickname into own

   connections, x = apply to current server connection, d = single
   message window, n = notify list, and u = urls list.
11.Fixed DCC Chat speech bug that caused text in a DCC Chat window not
   to be spoken if speech was enabled only for that nickname.
12.Changed /server to search servers list using combination of server
   address, group, and description.

07/11/2014 - mIRC v7.37

Changes:
1.Fixed /window -dC bug not centering @window on the same the
  monitor as the main mIRC window.
2.Fixed Window Order dialog not allowing entry of long channel names.
3.Fixed $sockerr being incorrectly set in some socket events.
4.Fixed font display bug that caused mIRC to use a blank font if the
  font name was empty in the [fonts] section in mirc.ini.
5.Fixed channels list display bug when list reply includes channel
  modes. The modes are no longer displayed in the channels list.
6.Updated compiler options to improve buffer overrun defenses and
  enabled heap metadata protection on Vista onwards.
7.Added check for numeric 447 issued by some servers when a /list
  request is sent.
8.Added Windows entering sleep/hibernation detection at which point
  mIRC will immediately save unwritten INI settings as a precaution.
9.Added STARTTLS support using the CAP tls protocol.

  To initiate a secure connection to a STARTTLS capable server, you
  can use the /server -t switch or prefix the port number with a
  star sign, eg. *6667.

  On connecting to a server, mIRC now sends CAP LS and waits for a
  reply from the server before logging on. This allows mIRC to
  determine if STARTTLS is supported and to initiate STARTTLS before
  logon credentials are sent.

  If a server replies with a CAP reply, mIRC processes the CAP reply,
  initiates STARTTLS if supported, and then logs on. If STARTTLS is
  not supported, mIRC cancels the connection.

  If a server replies with numeric 451 (not registered), indicating
  it does not recognize CAP, mIRC cancels the connection.

  If a server does not reply at all, after a few seconds of waiting,
  mIRC sends a PING. If a server replies with a PONG or numeric 451,
  indicating it does not support CAP, mIRC cancels the connection.

10.Added /sockopen -t switch that initiates an SSL negotiation on a
   non-SSL connection, eg. as with STARTTLS, and a $sock().starttls
   identifier.
11.Fixed /sockread unsetting local variable instead of setting it to
   an empty value in some contexts.
12.Fixed /whois results being incorrectly displayed in @debug window
   if it happened to be active in some contexts.
13.Fixed SSL port cycling bug.
14.Added /sockwrite -a switch that prevents characters in the range
   0-255 from being UTF-8 encoded, as long as the line only contains
   characters in the range 0-255.
15.Fixed /server -nm not setting channels list filename correctly
   when server window is created.
16.Changed channels list "hide non-text channels" option to allow
   display of double-prefix channels.
17.Changed status window titlebar to include port number when not
   connected so you can see if the next connection attempt will be
   secure or not.
18.Fixed recent server connections not being saved to servers.ini file
   if the "move to top on connect" option was disabled.
19.Changed servers history menu to correctly show the history of
   servers you have connected to as opposed to servers at the top of
   the servers list. If you select "clear history", it now clears the
   history as expected.
20.Added ircs:// support to URL catcher.
21.Changed log view window, opened by logging dialog, so that it is
   positioned at the end of the switchbar/treebar window list.
22.Fixed switchbar/treebar display bug that caused windows to be
   displayed in the wrong order in some situations.
23.Changed $sound() to use the TagLib library for improved reading of
   MP3 and other media file formats.

   through text.
25.Fixed timezone bug that caused timezones with non-whole hour offsets
   to be handled incorrectly.
26.Updated manifest files to indicate Windows 8/8.1 compatibility.
27.Extended $os identifier to detect 8.1.
28.Fixed dialogs display bug that caused dialogs opened via MDI window
   system menu to be offset incorrectly.
29.Fixed $did bug that caused $did to be reset inside an event in some
   situations.
30.Changed SSL accepted cipher list to ALL:!ADH:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXP:
   !3DES:!RC4:!MD5:!PSK:!SRP:!DSS:!SSLv2:!LOW.
31.Added "ciphers" item to [ssl] section in mirc.ini that allows you
   to specify list of accepted ciphers.
32.Updated libraries to PCRE v8.36 and OpenSSL 1.0.1j.
33.Changed connection error messages to include actual SSL error
   messages provided by OpenSSL.
34.Changed $input() to allow entering of longer text and limiting text
   entry to maximum length.
35.Fixed text display spacing bug with zero width characters.
36.Fixed timezone/daylight savings bug that was affecting timestamping
   and time/date identifiers.

14/08/2014 - mIRC v7.36

Changes:
1.Fixed mark/copy text bug.
2.Updated the replace dialog in the script editor to remember its
  position for the current mIRC session.
3.Fixed /alias incorrectly halting script in some situations.
4.Fixed SSL "Unable to get certificate CRL" bug.
5.Reverted change to $sslversion so that it returns only the version
  number and excludes the "OpenSSL" prefix.
6.Updated libraries to OpenSSL 1.0.1i.

04/08/2014 - mIRC v7.35

Changes:
1.Fixed slow mark/copy text in windows that contain long lines.
2.Fixed listbox lines in Options dialog and other windows being
  vertically chopped when DPI settings are set to a high value of
  200% or more.
3.Reverted change to alias/identifiers when called recursively that
  caused the script to be halted with a recursion error warning.
4.Fixed listbox with checkboxes bug that caused checkboxes to be
  checked if you scrolled through them with the up/down keys.
5.Changed channel folder dialog so that it can now be resized.
6.Changed online timer dialog to display information more clearly.
7.Added /timer -zN switch to reset online timer, where N = 0 resets
  current and total time, N = 1 resets current time, and N = 2 resets
  total time.
8.Added $onlineserver to return current server online time and
  $onlinetotal to return total online time.
9.Fixed Shift+Tab beeping when switching to listbox in channel window.
10.Fixed $fullscreen not working on a non-primary monitor.
11.Updated SSL routines to allow both static and dynamic linking of
   OpenSLL with mIRC. mIRC now comes with OpenSSL 1.0.1h linked
   statically, so SSL is available without needing external DLLS.
   However, if mIRC finds a newer version of OpenSSL on your system,
   it will load that automatically.
12.Added SSL option that allows you to control whether the internal
   or external version of OpenSSL is loaded, by adding "load=N" to the
   [ssl] section in mirc.ini, where N = 0 means "use internal, external
   if newer", N = 1 means "use external always", and N = 2 means "use
   internal always". The default is 0. If no external is available, or
   there is an error loading external, internal is used.
13.Fixed SSL routines not checking if a private certificate was loaded
   either in the same file as the private key or as part of a separate
   certificate chain file.
14.Updated the find dialog in the script editor to remember its position
   for the current mIRC session.
15.Fixed favorites bug where if multiple networks are defined for a
   channel, and you click the join button, mIRC was only connecting to
   the first network. mIRC now connects to all of the networks defined
   for that channel and will open new status windows if necessary.
16.Fixed lock dialog bug that caused mIRC to ask for a password if the
   on startup option was enabled without setting a password.
17.Fixed $input() 'b' switch so that the dialog window close button is
   also temporarily disabled. This also applies to other dialogs that
   use this feature.
18.Fixed isignore only accepting types, now also accepts switches.
19.Fixed CAP server-time time value not being used when timestamping
   an event in the log file.

18/06/2014 - mIRC v7.34

Changes:
1.Fixed SendMessage() bug that prevented mIRC from processing incoming
  WM_MCOMMAND/WM_MEVALUATE messages correctly.
2.Changed right-click popup menu item order for Treebar, Switchbar and
  Toolbar for common menu items so that they match.
3.Added Switchbar font option to right-click popup menu.
4.Changed Switchbar to display active window tab in a slightly different
  color when a background picture for the Switchbar is set.
5.Changed tooltip display delay to use the Windows default tooltip
  display delay value.
6.Changed Clear History feature to not delete some interface settings,
  such as font settings for Treebar, Switchbar, and Scripts Editor and
  background picture settings for Treebar, Switchbar, and Toolbar.
7.Changed installer to default to upgrade mode if installing over an
  existing installation when using the /S silent option and added a
  /FULL command line option to force a full install.
8.Fixed DNS resolution bug that would have returned incorrect results
  during multiple simultaneous DNS requests in rare contexts.
9.Updated libraries to OpenSSL 1.0.1h.
10.Added Lock dialog option to disable SendMessage. If cMethod value
   16 is used for more useful error messages, returns 64 to indicate
   SendMessage is disabled. You can use $lock(sendmessage) to check
   if it is disabled.
11.Extended mouse wheel to work in interface elements, such as list
   boxes in dialogs, under the cursor even if they are not active.
12.Added /comlist command to list open com objects.
13.Added $servertarget identifier to return address specified in the
   /server command, which may not be the same as $server.
14.Added /play -x switch to treat the first line in the file as plain
   text even if it is a number.
15.Fixed custom dialog listbox with checkboxes not working correctly
   on Windows 8 tablet touch screens.

27/05/2014 - mIRC v7.33

Changes:
1.Fixed $ini() bug that resulted in an incorrect count being returned
  with a particular combination of subject and key parameters.
2.Added /var -n switch to make /var treat input as plain text.
3.Fixed /loadbuf bug that skipped empty lines when loading a topic.
4.Changed HTTP routines to use POST with form parameters instead of
  GET with URL parameters.
5.Fixed $line() with Channels List window so that it references the
  current search results instead of the full list.
6.Fixed while/if loop error reporting bug.
7.Fixed /hotlink -m menu not working correctly when a menu item is
  selected.
8.Fixed channel central limit bug that caused invalid limit values
  sent by the server to be stored incorrectly.
9.Fixed channel titlebar not displaying numeric modes.
10.Fixed /timer bug when using the [time] parameter that caused it
   to execute twice on reaching [time].
11.Extended server/history popup menu so that if you hold down either
   the shift or control key and click, it opens a new server window.
12.Changed /localhost -p UPnP method to use local interface address
   instead of 127.0.0.1.
13.Fixed on SOCKWRITE event not being triggered for UDP events when
   an error occurs.
14.Fixed editbox focus not being set on restored desktop windows.
15.Fixed script editor focus not being set if it is in MDI mode and
   you switch to a window outside of mIRC and then back to mIRC.
16.Fixed right-click popup menus in listbox windows not working on
   Windows 8 tablet touch screens when using press-and-hold.
17.Fixed INI file save bug that was causing a gpf if the INI file
   was already in use by another application.
18.Fixed full screen menubar bug that caused the menubar to be
   displayed incorrectly in a multi-monitor setup in some cases.
19.Added /fopen -x switch that opens a file for exclusive access. If
   another application is using the file, /fopen will fail.
20.Fixed /hsave to an INI file not clearing section before writing
   hash table items to it.
21.Changed Options/Display/Buttons option to allow "Small" or "Large".
   This now changes both the toolbar and switchbar size. The size is
   scaled based on screen resolution and DPI settings. If installed
   on a tablet, the large button size is chosen by default.
22.Fixed /echo -h bug that caused text not to hard-wrap.
23.Fixed $ctime() bug where "nd" values were not being recognized.
24.Updated libraries to PCRE v8.35 and OpenSSL 1.0.1g.
25.Fixed $msfile() bug when too many filenames were selected under
   Windows 7/8.
26.Fixed $sdir() bug that caused selected folder not to be scrolled
   into view when dialog is displayed under Windows 7/8.
27.Added math identifiers $atan2(y,x), $hypot(x,y), $log10(x),
   $sinh(x), $cosh(x), $tanh(x).
28.Fixed $onpoly() bug due to rounding errors that may have returned
   $true in rare cases where two lines are very close.
29.Added $intersect(x1,y1,x2,y2,x3,y3,x4,y4,method) identifier that
   returns the point at which two lines/rays intersect. The method
   parameter is optional. If not specified, two lines are compared.
   If specified, it can be lr, rl, rr = line/ray, ray/line, ray/ray.
30.Fixed /drawdot bug that caused it to be drawn slightly off center.
31.Added $input() 'f' switch that forces the return of $no/$cancel
   for edit/combo boxes.
32.Fixed SSL certificate password dialog box being displayed multiple
   times when multiple SSL connections are in progress.
33.Added display of "Connect cancelled" message when a connection
   attempt/retry cycle has ended completely.
34.Added a single, standard lock/password dialog for use by all
   features to replace multiple older implementations.
35.Fixed SendMessage() WM_MCOMMAND bug that would have returned a
   successful result to the calling application even if the command
   had in fact failed.
36.Added support for encrypting server passwords in servers.ini. Old
   plain text passwords are converted to the new format.
37.Changed List Channels dialog lock password so that a hash is stored
   in mirc.ini instead of the actual password. The old password is
   converted to the new format.
38.Fixed SSL certificate password dialog box bug that, on being
   displayed, caused controls to be enabled even if user was currently
   typing in another window.
39.Added another method for detecting Wine, as a backup to the current
   method.
40.Extended SendMessage() to enable executing a command in the context
   of a remote event. During a remote event, a $eventid identifier is
   set to a unique value to identify the event. This can be passed to a
   DLL which can then pass it back to mIRC using:

   SendMessage(mHwnd, WM_MCOMMAND, MAKEWPARAM(cMethod, cEventId), cIndex)

   This will cause the command/evaluation to execute in the context
   of the remote event identified by cEventId. If cEventId is 0, this
   indicates a non-remote event.
41.Extended SendMessage() to return information about mIRC using
   SendMessage(mHwnd, WM_MCOMMAND, -1, lParam) where lParam is -1 to
   receive the mIRC version number and -2 to receive the cMethod
   options that are supported.
42.Extended SendMessage() to support cMethod value 16 which causes
   SendMessage() to return more useful error values instead of just
   0 for failure and 1 for success. The return values are: 0 = success,
   1 = failure or'd with 2 = bad mapfile name, 4 = bad mapfile size,
   8 = bad eventid, 16 = bad server, 32 = bad script.
43.Fixed hotlinks display bug that affected how hotlinks were displayed
   in dialogs.
44.Fixed topics, modes, and several other events not including the year
   that the mode was set.
45.Changed About dialog to include check for update button.
46.Added installer check for limited user write access to the selected
   install folder when the "portable" option is enabled.
47.Fixed alias/identifier behaviour inconsistency when a recursive call
   is attempted which could have led to unexpected results. Both now
   halt the script with an error message instead.
48.Changed installer to include links to license and privacy policy.
49.Added CAP userhost-in-names support.
50.Changed CAP support so that CAP END will only be sent once the
   server has replied to all requests with ACK or NAK and requests have
   been processed.
51.Fixed timezone/daylight savings bug due to a hack around a bug in a
   previous version of the C runtime library.
52.Fixed all server messages, such as MOTD, not being timestamped when
   timestamp option is enabled.
53.Added CAP server-time and znc.in/server-time[-iso] support. Enabled
   automatically with a CAP request if server lists it in CAP LS. If a
   server message has a @time prefix with a UTC timestamp, $msgstamp
   will return this value.
54.Extended /echo -tN where N is the UTC value you want to use as the
   timestamp.
55.Added support for ircs:// secure links.
56.Improved irc/ircs:// links support in the windows registry by adding
   the following entries: Class\mIRCURL, Software\Clients\IM\mIRC, and
   Software\RegisteredApplications\mIRC.
57.Changed /timer to display seconds in /timers and in $timer().delay,
   if seconds are specified on command line.
58.Changed /window -c to not report an error if the non-@window it is
   closing does not exist.
59.Fixed status/channel/query right-click popup menu bug that caused
   clicked target not setting $1 correctly if /remote is off.
60.Fixed an SSL threading bug that may have caused SSL connections to
   gpf in some situations.
61.Fixed scripts editor file change monitor bug that may have caused
   some file change notifications to be missed.
62.Changed $ticks so that it uses GetTickCount64() if it is available.
63.Fixed /list command bug that caused the channels list to be saved
   to the wrong filename in the channels folder if you were connected
   to multiple servers.
64.Fixed $read()/play random number bias.
65.Changed $shortfn()/$longfn() to use more reliable method.
66.Fixed $input() display bug with long strings.

23/05/2013 - mIRC v7.32

Changes:
1.Fixed messages being text-wrapped incorrectly in some situations.
2.Fixed SSL certificate files specified in SSL options dialog not
  being loaded and used correctly when connecting to a server.
3.Fixed SSL disconnect bug where if an SSL connection failed, other
  SSL connections would be disconnected.
4.Updated libraries to zlib 1.2.8 and OpenSSL 1.0.1e.

26/04/2013 - mIRC v7.31

Changes:
1.Fixed editbox buffer bug that was not storing an edited line if you
  pressed the up key.
2.Fixed incremental search not working correctly in channels list
  window.
3.Changed email catcher to be more strict when determining whether
  something looks like an email address.
4.Fixed installer issue that may been the cause of popups.ini files
  being overwritten in some situations.
5.Added installer command line options /DESKTOP, /NODESKTOP, /STARTMENU
  and /NOSTARTMENU to enable/disable creation of shortcut icons.
6.Added "On Top" menu item to the View menu as users have difficulty
  finding it in the system menu when it is enabled.
7.Changed the "File changed" dialog so that it is closed automatically
  if a load/reload command applies to the same file.
8.Extended $encode/$decode to support blowfish. By default, the method
  is compatible with OpenSSL and uses CBC, key hashing, a random salt
  and PKCS#5 padding. The identifier format is:

    $encode(%var | &binvar, switches, key, [salt | iv])
    $decode(%var | &binvar, switches, key, [salt | iv])

  Where the switches are:

    method: c = cbc or e = ecb encryption (one or the other)
    key: l = literal key (optional, must be 56 characters)
    salt/iv: s = salt or i = iv or r = randomiv (all optional)
    padding: z = zeros, n = one and zeros, p = spaces (all optional)

9.Fixed SSL caching bug that may have required repeat acceptance of
  certficates on some networks. The cache now stores the IP address
  of the associated certificate.
10.Changed connection retry method so that if a connection attempt to
   an SSL server fails, and the server is part of an IP pool, the next
   retry will use the same SSL port.
11.Added DPI awareness to prevent Windows applying display scaling to
   mIRC. This should resolve the blurry interface and font issues when
   non-standard DPI display settings are used. A number of GUI-related
   features needed to be updated to cater for this change, eg. fonts
   now use internal defaults of points versus logical sizes. This may
   affect scripts that use dialogs and /draw on systems with non-
   standard DPI settings.
12.Fixed drag-drop bug that may have caused a gpf when switching
   windows between MDI/desktop mode.
13.Added MONITOR protocol support for the notify list. mIRC will use
   MONITOR automatically if it is listed in the 005 numeric.
14.Fixed "Check for update" dialog display bug that occurred when the
   connection to the website timed out.
15.Fixed $& indentation bug in scripts editor dialog.
16.Changed notify list to dynamically switch between WATCH/MONITOR and
   ISON when the number of nicks in the notify list is within/beyond
   the WATCH/MONITOR limit set by the server.
17.Optimized switchbar and treebar display speed.
18.Fixed switchbar "auto" lines feature being disabled when switchbar
   is repositioned. It is now only disabled if switchbar is resized
   vertically.
19.Fixed timestamp bug that may have caused a gpf in some situations if
   your timestamp was very long.
20.Fixed timestamp part of a message not being wrapped correctly when
   message is initially displayed in a window.
21.Fixed mIRC not handling mouse buttons correctly in some situations
   if the user's system is configured to swap mouse buttons.
22.Changed the way the window buffer is trimmed when it reaches the
   maximum number of lines set in the Options/Other dialog.
23.Added /close -lk to close channels list and links list windows. Note
   that channels list windows cannot be closed if currently listing.
24.Optimized SSL routines.
25.Added SSL identifiers $sslversion, $ssldll and $ssllibdll.
26.Added logging dialog option to enable/disable automatic logging
   of status windows.
27.Changed reload log feature so that it is enabled by default for
   channels and chats.

Changes:
1.Fixed notify list right-click bug that caused the popup menu to not
  be displayed or to beep in some situations.
2.Fixed /vol -v not setting master volume on newer versions of Windows.
3.Added support for numerics 275 and 276 in whois replies on specific
  ircds.
4.Extended $os to detect Windows 8.
5.Fixed urls in own messages not being saved to the urls list.

08/12/2012 - mIRC v7.28

Changes:
1.Fixed help file issue that prevented /help command from jumping to
  the correct location on a help page.
2.Fixed /run command issue that affected backward compatibility with
  ambiguous parameter formats used in older scripts.
3.Fixed auto-hide nicklist not hiding when mouse is moved outside of
  the channel window in some contexts.
4.Changed Escape key so that it clears the current editbox if the
  "Escape key minimizes window" option is not enabled.
5.Fixed channel nicklist popup menu being wrongly displayed when right-
  clicking in nicklist area and nicklist is auto-hidden.
6.Fixed /exit -r bug not restarting mIRC when scripts editor dialog is
  open with unsaved files.

30/07/2010 - mIRC v7.1

Changes:
1.This is the first stable release of the new Unicode version of mIRC.

  The project to convert mIRC to Unicode has taken almost two years of
  development and testing and has required tens of thousands of changes
  to 150,000+ lines of source code. This has been the most complex and
  time-consuming update to mIRC since it was created in 1995, when it
  started out as a non-Unicode, 16-bit, Windows 3.1 application.

  Many areas of mIRC have had to be updated or re-written, from file
  handling to text processing, from display to memory allocation, from
  server communications to file transfers.

  mIRC should now be faster, more stable, and more compatible with
  the latest versions of Windows, and should be able to better handle
  the display and input of a variety of languages.

  In addition to being converted to Unicode, there are a few other
  notable changes:

  Improved Windows 7 compatibility
  More reliable INI file handling
  Faster text display/scrolling
  Speech support
  Improved interface design for a number of features
  Automatic text color correction
  Menubar Alt key show/hide feature
  Support for italic text and other font styles
  Optimized SSL routines
  Status window SSL connection icon
  IPv6 support
  Improved portable support
  Persistent channel history
  Digitally signed executables
  Automatic splitting of long channel/private messages
  Full screen display with F11 function key
  UPnP support
  Many bug fixes
  And more

  list of changes starting with v7.0.

28/05/2010 - mIRC v7.04

Changes:
1.Added UPnP support. The Ports dialog allows you to enable UPnP
  support for retrieving your external IP address, the identd server,
  DCC connections, and the DCC server. The first three options are
  enabled by default.

  mIRC marks UPnP ports that it opens as "mIRC". It closes UPnP ports
  the moment they are no longer needed.

  If mIRC is connecting to multiple servers at the same that use both
  IPv4 and IPv6, the UPnP port for the identd server will only be able
  to handle either IPv4 or IPv6 at any one time, since a UPnP port can
  only be bound to one address.

  If you make any changes to the UPnP options in the Ports dialog, mIRC
  performs a quick check to see if UPnP is available and will warn you
  if it is not.

2.Added /socklisten -p switch to enable UPnP support for a listening
  socket.
3.Changed hotlink feature to handle more formats.

5.Optimized display routine to use bitmap caching more efficiently.
6.Changed the way a server connection is closed after sending /quit to
  make disconnection more robust/graceful.
7.Added check for empty servers list. If servers list is empty, mIRC
  looks for the "defaults" folder and copies the servers.ini from
  there to the data folder.

20/05/2010 - mIRC v7.03

Changes:
1.Changed DCC Send/Get windows to show long progress bar when window
  is maximized.
2.Changed DCC Send/Get switchbar buttons to display progress bar in
  black during transfer and grey when finished.
3.Fixed /fseek line matching bugs.
4.Optimized BOM-checking in file routines, should have minimal impact
  on read/write speed now.

6.Changed Control+N back to shortcut for channel switching.
7.Added "Split long channel/query messages" option to Messages dialog.
  If a message is long enough that it might be chopped by the maximum
  server line length, it is sent as mutliple lines.
8.Fixed font bug with reading font settings from mirc.ini.
9.Optimized display routine, should be faster in some situations.
10.Changed richedit editbox support back to riched20.dll since it
   seems to be faster and more reliable overall.
11.Optimized the way scripts are loaded into script editor editbox.
12.Fixed INI file handling bug when reading section/item/data that
   are enclosed in quotes.
13.Fixed hotlink feature not handling single-word hostnames.
14.Changed $utfencode/$utfdecode to return input text if they are
   unable to encode/decode the text instead of returning an error.
15.Changed the way the file routines set end-of-file and error, should
   behave more like older versions now.
16.Added /raw -n switch to prevent characters in the range 0-255 being
   UTF-8 encoded when sent to the server. Also added a $rawbytes
   identifier that returns the incoming server message prior to any
   parsing/decoding.

01/05/2010 - mIRC v7.02

Changes:
1.Added Unicode/UTF-8 BOM support to file routines. This applies to all
  files that are read or written as text, including INI files.
2.Changed DCC Send/Get windows to allow full filename to be viewed when
  window is resized.
3.Changed DCC Get to open download file with exclusive write access.
4.Added support for detecting Wine so that mIRC can use alternative
  code for features that need it. Around fifteen separate workarounds
  were implemented. Features that could not be made to work reliably
  (richedit editbox support and playing mp3 and mid files) are now
  disabled.
5.Changed mouse wheel scroll method in the script editor editbox to
  allow faster/smoother scrolling.
6.Fixed system shell DDE messages bug.
7.Changed font-linking implementation slightly, should be faster and
  support more characters.
8.Added support for /dns $server to fill $serverip for SOCKS5 users,
  though note that this results in a DNS leak.

15/04/2010 - mIRC v7.01

Changes:
1.Changed the way fonts are set for editboxes in windows and in the
  script editor. This should resolve issues for users who are seeing
  the font change when they enter text.
2.Changed the foregound/background color correction feature so that it
  no longer applies if a ^K background color is specified.
3.Fixed /filter gpf bug.
4.Fixed /fopen gpf bug.
5.Changed $input() icons default sound behavior.
6.Fixed text display bug where last character was not entirely visible
  in some situations with certain fonts.
7.Changed toolbar and switchbar to not display separators when
  background picture is used.
8.Fixed timestamp bug where the timestamp was not being displayed if a
  Unicode character was used in the format string.
9.Changed numeric 451 "You have not registered" message for the "CAP"
  request to no longer be displayed when connecting to a server.
10.Fixed DDE support. Most applications, such as web browsers, can only
   reply to ANSI DDE requests, so mIRC now sends DDE requests in ANSI
   as opposed to Unicode. mIRC can now reply to both Unicode and ANSI
   DDE requests.
11.Changed identd default behavior when choosing userid from email
   address or identd userid field.
12.Fixed $ini()/loadbuf combination bug that was fixing/updating an
   incorrectly formatted INI file even though it was only being read
   by the script.
13.Changed /filter to allow output to the NUL device.
14.Fixed "End of /MOTD" message not being displayed in some cases.
15.Fixed /speak not working with older voices/engines.
16.Fixed /sockwrite -n and /write -a CRLF bugs.

02/04/2010 - mIRC v7.0

Changes:
1.mIRC is now a Unicode application.
2.mIRC now uses its own custom INI routines to ensure more reliable
  INI file handling. They should work almost identically to the
  standard Windows INI routines.
3.Changed the way microsoft agent is detected by checking for folder
  instead of loading agent to cater for Windows 7 issue.
4.Added a bitmap cache to speed up window text display. Depending on
  the font you are using, your cleartype settings, and/or your cpu
  speed, you should see a significant increase in display speed of text
  in all windows.
5.Fixed script editor not filling as much of the editbox buffer as
  it could (up to maximum size of 500k) when reading a file.
6.Updated to PCRE library v8.02 and enabled Unicode/UTF-8 support.
7.Fixed /drawrot gpf bug.
8.Fixed tooltips cpu usage bug under Windows 7.

   to the left of the main monitor.
11.Now using gdi+ for picture loading/saving.
12.Fix internal http routines not handling redirects correctly.
13.Updated to SAPI5+ speech and voice commands to make them work with
   Windows 7.
14.Added Speech dialog to Sounds dialog. This replaces the Agents dialog
   which is no longer supported by Windows 7. If mIRC notices that
   Agents are available on your version of Windows, the Agents dialog
   option will still be available.
15.Added /speak -spclu [speed] [pitch] [text] command which speaks the
   specified text, where the switches are:

   -s = speed (0 to 100)
   -p = pitch (0 to 100)
   -c = clear all queued lines
   -l = apply lexicon settings in speech dialog.
   -u = apply option settings in speech dialog

   You can use $speak(N) to list all lines that are currently queued
   for speaking through the /speak command. If N = 0, returns total
   number of queued lines.

16.Extended maximum incoming server line length from 600 to 1024
   bytes.
17.Fixed default notify sounds not being saved with relative path.
18.Fixed popup loading bug when a file contains empty lines.
19.Fixed on CLOSE event bug with status window requiring * prefix.
20.Extended on CLOSE event to work with channels.
21.Changed on OPEN/CLOSE events to handle parameters like other
   similar events. This should not affect existing scripts.
22.Added script editor file menu options "Rename" and "Delete".
23.Added [about] portable=[yes|no] item to mirc.ini that allows you
   to enable portable mode more easily on usb drives.
24.Changed mouse wheel routine to correctly handle faster/slower
   scrolling.
25.Added CAP LS protocol support. mIRC now sends "CAP LS" as the first
   line when connecting to a server before sending NICK/USER to logon.
   Currently enables "multi-prefix" and "packet-size=1024" if they are
   available.
26.Fixed listbox item height in Control/Color/Highlight dialogs.
27.Fixed text display being clipped incorrectly when using certain
   fonts.
28.The Channels List window now updates the horizontal scrollbar
   on-the-fly to avoid the display freeze after listing a large number
   of channels.
29.Fixed some controls not being disabled in Lock dialog when lock is
   enabled.
30.When clicking reset button in Colors dialog, colors are now reset
   to the most recent active settings for that theme.
31.mIRC now skips sending "mode +i" on connect if it has already been
   set automatically by the server.
32.Changed the design of some of the dialogs in the Options dialog,
   the DCC Send/Get dialogs, and others.
33.mIRC no longer requires Full Name and Email Address to be filled
   in the connect dialog and sends default values if left empty.
34.On connecting to a server, if both nick and alternative are in use
   mIRC appends a random number to your nickname and tries again.
35.Changed /debug windows to no longer interpret colors. They now
   display control codes as plain text.
36.Changed USER/NICK logon method to comply with RFC2812.
37.Changed switchbar DCC Send/Get button progress bar, now displays a
   small bar under the text.
38.Optimized Unicode font-linking routines.
39.Now using Visual Studio 2008 to compile mIRC.
40.Added WM_PRINTCLIENT support to a number of controls including the
   toolbar, switchbar, and treebar.

42.Fixed /debug windows log menu not being set correctly.
43.Fixed mIRC main window system menu not being set correctly when
   the menbuar is disabled.
44.Renamed "Firewall" dialog "Proxy". Replaced /firewall command with
   /proxy although /firewall is still supported.
45.mIRC now disables the proxy if it is enabled in the proxy dialog
   but no address is provided and a SOCKS_HOST environment variable
   does not exist.
46.Added menbuar auto-show/hide feature that displays the menubar
   when you press the Alt key and hides it afterwards.
47.Keyboard focus now automatically switches to the treebar if all
   other windows are minimized.
48.Fixed PCRE gpf bug when expression results in heavy recursion.
49.Changed switchbar to display transparent buttons when a background
   picture is selected.
50.Added support for all available font styles, such as italic and
   semi-bold, in font dialog.
51.Added support for Control+I key combination to make italic text
   using control code 29.
52.Added support for DLLs that use Unicode routines. By default mIRC
   assumes that DLL routines are ANSI for backwards compatibility.
   However a DLL can enable Unicode support by setting mUnicode to
   TRUE in the LOADINFO structure:

   typedef struct {
     DWORD  mVersion;
     HWND   mHwnd;
     BOOL   mKeep;
     BOOL   mUnicode;
   } LOADINFO;

53.Added SendMessage WM_MEVALUATE/WM_MCOMMAND support for Unicode.
   By default mIRC assumes that mapped file data is ANSI for backwards
   compatibility. However an application can "or" the value 8 in the
   cMethod parameter to specify Unicode data.
54.Changed display behavior for a number of dialogs, such as the DCC
   Send/Get dialogs, so that buttons are now disabled for a short time
   when the dialogs are displayed to prevent accidental typing. If the
   user is typing, the buttons remain disabled until the user stops.

   Added a 'b' switch to $input() and an "option disable" property to
   custom dialogs that enables this behavior.

55.Fixed treebar display bug when displaying DCC window names.
56.Changed script editor Order dialog to automatically select the
   active script in the listbox on opening.
57.Updated editbox in all windows and script editor to use richedit 4.1
   msftedit.dll for improved Unicode support. If not available reverts
   to riched20.dll.
58.Changed line numbering method in script editor, uses more reliable
   method that is independent of editbox.
59.Changed status window icon to display a yellow lock when on a secure
   connection using SSL.
60.Fixed Control+K color dialog centering bug.
61.Changed servers list sorting method so that the networks listed in
   the [networks] section of servers.ini are now placed at the top.
62.Changed DCC Send/Get transfer windows default font, now uses the
   system dialog font. Also switched to appropriate system font for
   measurements in features such as $input() and popup menus.
63.Changed design of DCC Send/Get transfer windows, interface is now
   clearer and the display updates once a second.
64.Changed flood protection to begin working only after receiving the
   first numeric to prevent logon issues in some situations.
65.Changed design of the File Type warning dialog, now clearer and also
   shows the file extension that was ignored.
66.Optimized the way line indentation works, such as for /echo -iN,
   and other displayed lines.
67.Improved tab and indent spacing measurement method for both fixed
   and non-fixed width fonts.
68.Improved text-wrapping at whole word boundaries, and now wraps at
   both spaces and commas.
69.Numeric 422 "MOTD file is missing" message is no longer displayed
   when first connecting to a server.
70.Fixed proxy errors not being displayed correctly in some situations.
71.Added a bind listbox to the Connect/Options/Ports dialog that lists
   all active networks interfaces for easy selection. It still allows
   you to enter an IP address as well.
72.Updated /dns command, now multi-threaded, resolves concurrently,
   and can return both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. By default, /dns only
   returns IPv4. You can use the switches -46 to return a combination
   of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
73.Added support for IPv6 connections. By default, mIRC will always use
   IPv4, so IPv6 support must be explicitly enabled using one of these
   methods:

   1) Enable IPv6 support in the Connect/Options/Ports dialog. This
   allows mixed IPv4 and IPv6 connections, with IPv6 taking priority
   in DNS resolution. This means that if you try to connect to a server
   that has both IPv6 and IPv4 addresses, mIRC will try IPv6 first.

   2) The bind option in the Connect/Options/Ports dialog. If you
   specify an IPv4 or IPv6 adapter/address, DNS resolution and all
   connections will be made based on the adapter/address type. If you
   explicitly specify an IP address for a connection, such as a /server
   or DCC connection, it overrides this setting.

   3) The /server command with switches -46 to force DNS resolution
   to return either IPv4, IPv6, or both. If you specify an IP address,
   it overrides the switches. The server window will use the requested
   DNS method for all subsequent connections until you change it with
   the /server command.

   Note: in order to use IPv6, both your version of Windows and your
   Internet connection must support IPv6.

74.Added $iptype(text) identifier, returns "ipv4" or "ipv6" if text is
   is a valid IP address format. With IPv6 addresses, the properties
   .compress and .expand can be used.
75.Added cue text (optional) to Connect dialog for user name and email
   address.
76.Extended $portfree(port,ip) so that you can specify an ip address.
   If not specified, all active interfaces are checked as before. An
   adapter name can also be used instead of an ip address.
77.Added $bindip(N|ip) identifier. If N is specified, lists active
   network adapters with properties .name, .ip, .loopback. If an ip
   address is specified, returns best adapter for connecting to that
   ip address.
78.Updated to OpenSSL 0.9.8n library.
79.Updated installer to offer a portable install option that can be
   used to run mIRC on a USB flash drive.
80.Added support for whois numeric 729.
81.Added "Invalid certificate" disconnect message in the event of an
   SSL connection failing due to an invalid certificate. If there is a
   DNS pool, mIRC will now continue to retry the connection.
82.Changed /localinfo to report an error if you try to use an invalid
   switch. Also fixed /localinfo not setting/saving the local info
   results correctly across server windows.
83.Fixed hotlink shift-key display bug.
84.Fixed logfile bug when window is switched between MDI/desktop.
85.Added $file().sig property, checks digital signature of a file.
86.Added check for foreground/background colors in control codes in
   text. If they are the same, the foreground color is changed to
   ensure the text is visible.
87.Changed color dialog behavior: if you delete all schemes, the
   default schemes are added back to the list.
88.Changed position of history menu in file and favorites menus.
89.Added /close -t switch, closes all status windows. If used with -i
   switch, closes only if not connected/connecting to a server.
90.Channels history is now saved across sessions to the [chanhist]
   section in mirc.ini.
91.Fixed tips display bug that caused tip width to be smaller than
   necessary, shortening the title text.
92.Fixed SSL warning dialog bug, was not showing the actual error
   message in some cases when a certificate error was detected.
93.Fixed /var gpf bug.

17/10/2008 - mIRC v6.35

Changes:
1.Fixed nickname bug where very long nicknames (hundreds of characters
  in length) sent by the server would cause mIRC to gpf.
2.Updated to PCRE v7.8 and OpenSSL 0.9.8i libraries.
3.Added script editor option to disable line numbers.
4.Fixed /toolbar bug where setting a bitmap for a default button was
  not working correctly.

3.Fixed window positions not being saved correctly for certain types
  of windows.

  reloading a log file.
7.Fixed $calc() returning +/-0 in some situations.
8.Improved handling of hotlinks enclosed in brackets.
9.Fixed server ports bug when using toolbar connect button.
10.Fixed color display bug in tips title/message text.

   the corresponding bar is hidden.
13.Fixed $hfind/$regml regex bug.
14.Fixed channels list window focus bug when getting list.
15.Fixed script editor editbox warning to take account of long wrapped
   lines.
16.Fixed window focusing bug in certain situations.
17.Fixed /toolbar load/save bug with @window parameters.
18.Fixed /did -d CRLF bug.
19.Fixed picture @window popup menu bug under Vista.
20.Added support for the transfer of files larger than four gigabytes.
   This required the following extension to the DCC transfer protocol:
   If mIRC sees that it is sending or receiving a file with a size
   larger than a 32bit value, it sends and expects to receive 64bit
   acks. In all other respects, the protocol is unchanged. Note that
   all previous versions of mIRC are unable to either send or receive
   such large files.
21.Changed file transfer CPS calculation method, now reflects the real
   average CPS over the last few seconds.
22.Improved the way the "Total Max Cps" feature throttles transfer
   speeds.
23.Increased the maximum allowed DCC Send packet size. This may or may
   not improve speed depending on your connection type.
24.Fixed DCC Send/Get bug where files of zero bytes in size could not
   be transfered.
25.Changed DCC Send so that it now always sends packets ahead of acks.
   This means that even if it receives no acks at all, mIRC will still
   transfer the file. If "Fast Send" is enabled, mIRC will attempt to
   send packets as fast as it can.
26.Fixed regex identifiers hiding output of called identifiers by
   default - they now require . prefix in calling alias.
27.Fixed /server switches not being remembered on an automatic retry
   connection attempt after a disconnection.
28.Fixed server connection not remembering SSL status if you disconnect
   and then reconnect to a server.
29.Fixed switchbar display button-sorting display bug.
30.Added $window().tbtext for window treebar text.
31.Added /editbox -vqN switches, where -v prevents the editbox contents
   from being changed and -qN enables/disables/toggles second editbox.
32.Added /var -g switch, sets global variable values.
33.Added $timer().pause property.
34.Added $input() 'm' switch which allows you to include multiple "text"
   parameters and to display them in a combobox. The first text item is
   the default item, the rest are the items in the list.
35.Fixed /log on command bug not using logs folder.
36.Optimized text mark/copy routine.
37.Added track urls warning when feature is enabled via system menu.
38.Changed Unicode display method slightly - mIRC now preloads the cache
   with the default system Unicode font and various other Unicode fonts
   if they are found on your system.
39.Fixed if/while bracket parser bug.
40.Added $chan/query/send/get/chat .idle properties.
41.Added editbox "automatic" lines feature to display/options dialog
   that dynamically changes the size of the primary editbox to show
   all of your typed text, up to half the size of the window.
42.Extended /window -eN switch where 0 = single, 1 = multi, 2 = auto,
   and 3 = default.
43.Changed Control+Home/End key behavior so that they move the cursor
   if you are editing text in a multi-line editbox, otherwise they
   scroll the display buffer.
44.Updated to OpenSSL 0.9.8h library.
45.Changed Enter key behavior in multi/auto editbox so that it sends
   a line when pressed in the middle of a line. To insert a line you
   can use the Alt+Enter key combination.
46.Changed Status Window editbox to reflect single/multi/auto editbox
   settings.
47.Fixed UTF-8 text-wrapping display bug.
48.Fixed SSL certificate caching bug when maximum cache size exceeded.

   the use of longer variables, channel and nick names, and other
   items.
13.Optimized $strip() control codes routine, used through-out mIRC.

3.Fixed /toolbar -fl bug when an item in toolbar.ini contained a
  popup @menu.

  popup close to edge of Windows desktop.

17.Fixed color codes not being processed properly in wrapped lines
   in some situations.
18.Fixed URL links not being opened with default browser under Vista.
19.The -r command line switch behavior has been changed so that if
   no path is specified after -r, mIRC will use the executable path.
20.For Vista compatibility, new installations of mIRC now save all
   settings in the User's "Application Data\mIRC" folder by default.

   However, if the installer or mIRC find mirc.ini in the same folder
   as mirc.exe they will use the mirc.exe folder for all settings.
   Users installing over an old version of mIRC should therefore see
   no change in behavior.

   The installer is now also aware of administrator and standard user
   accounts and installs mIRC accordingly.

21.Fixed command prefix /!. parsing inconsistencies across routines.
22.Fixed "// echo hello" being parsed as "//echo hello". The parser
   now halts parsing of empty // commands.

   kicked from a channel.

29.Fixed irc:// links not working under Vista.
30.Changed registry handling to ensure that mIRC works the same way
   whether run under administrator or standard user accounts.

   mIRC no longer updates the Uninstall section of the registry to
   point to the currently running mIRC, the Uninstall section is
   now only set by the installer. Removed -nouninst command line
   switch since this is no longer applicable.

   Also irc:// links are now only added to the Current User registry,
   not the local machine registry and this is only done when mIRC
   is run, not by the installer.

   The -service command line switch has been removed from the help
   file though it is still supported under 95/98/ME.

31.mIRC no longer uses an internal uninstaller, instead the install
   program now places an uninstall.exe in the mIRC folder.
32.Fixed dialog table definition not being able to call local aliases
   if dialog was opened from the command line.
33.Extended custom dialog "tab id" parameter to allow id to be an
   alias/identifier.
34.Fixed comments not being parsed correctly in the users list.
35.Fixed mouse cursor display bug during mark/copy.
36.Added internal U3 support to mIRC. mIRC looks for these command
   line parameters -appStart, -appStop, and -hostCleanUp, and looks
   for U3_HOST_EXEC_PATH and U3_APP_DATA_PATH environment variables.
37.Fixed INI storage bug when using -portable switch.
38.Changed -portable command line switch behavior. Now makes mIRC
   both 1) avoid use of the registry and 2) use the executable folder
   as the mirc.ini folder.

   and added not support for !> !<= etc.

   is specified, nick is used on all networks. Extended command to
   /notify -n <nick> [network] [note], where -n indicates network
   has been specified. Also added $notify().network.
44.Changed "Received Files" explorer display to show folders pane.
45.Notify/Urls list windows are now displayed in both the treebar
   and the switchbar.
46.Changed the way the notify list window is displayed on connect.
47.Added -noreg command line switch to make mIRC avoid use of the
   registry (to make up for old -portable behavior).
48.Fixed $input dialog (and other windows) not being centered on
   desktop correctly if main mIRC window was minimized.
49.Added support for numeric 005 TARGMAX and MAXTARGETS tokens
   when sending privmsgs and notices in /amsg, /ame, /qme, /qmsg,
   /omsg, and /onotice.
50.Fixed notify list routine that was not correctly optimized, may
   have led to high cpu usage/interface lag for some users.

   with keyboard shortcuts, eg. Alt+O, Alt+B, etc.
52.Added support for notify list display in treebar, option enabled
   via treebar popup menu.

   right-clicked treebar items. System menus are the default. Toggle
   by holding shift key while right-clicking.
54.Added $menutype and $menucontext to supplement $menu. They are
   available during popup menu creation and indicate the menu type
   and context of the menu being created.
55.Changed left-click method on treebar items, it takes one click to
   open and close windows now.
56.Fixed issues with /mkdir and $isdir(). $isdir() will now only
   accept folder names, whereas previously it was accepting filenames
   as well.
57.Changed status window icon so that you can now tell when it is
   connected, connecting, logging on, or disconnecting.
58.Alt+LeftClick no longer changes the status window icon, instead
   it now adds a down arrow to the button. When clicked it displays
   a popup menu of hidden windows.
59.The status window title in switchbar/treebar now always shows the
   network/server name, even when not connected.
60.Added Buffer menu to custom @window system menu.

   the list instead of updating an existing nick.

71.Improved error handling in /load command.

   position of these items in treebar.

   no longer documented.

76.The /setlayer command can now set the transparency of the main
   mIRC window.
77.When in the script editor mIRC no longer considers itself the
   active application, this allows flash/beep/etc. events to trigger.
78.All buttons that select/display files/folders now display the whole
   file/path with ellipsis if necessary.
79.Fixed nick color list freeze issue, instead of updating all nicks
   immediately when colors change, now only updates them when they
   are visible.
80.Moved highlight dialog to address book and added regex support.
81.Fixed options dialog memory leak.
82.Fixed "Move status window..." bug in Group dialog.
83.Fixed wildcard matching bug.
84.Added support for tips, text balloons that pop up near the Windows
   tray to notify you of various events such as incoming messages or
   users in your notify list coming on or leaving IRC.

   Tips only appear when mIRC is not the active application and are
   hidden the moment mIRC becomes active.

   Tips can be configured in the Options/Windows/Options dialog.

   The Highlight dialog in the Address Book also supports tips for
   matched items.

   Tips can also be scripted using the $tip() identifier:

   $tip(name,title,text,delay,iconfn,iconpos,alias,wid)
   Returns Nth position of tip if successful, zero if not.

   name - name of the tip
   title - title
   text - text
   delay - from 3 to 60 seconds
   iconfn - icon filename
   iconpos - icon position in filename
   alias - alias to perform when tip is double-clicked
   wid - id of window to which tip belongs

   name, title, text are required.
   delay, iconfn, iconpos, alias, and wid can be $null.

   $tip(name/N) can be used to list existing tips.

   Notes:

   Right-click in a tip pauses the time-out for all tips.

   Shift+Left-click in a tip closes that tip.

   Double-click in a tip triggers the alias if one is defined,
   or opens the associated window if not.

   The tip automatically fits the text into it and will at most
   widen to quarter of your screen width.

   New tips are queued until older tips time-out. Tips time-out
   at a slower rate if they are not at the head of the queue.

   If no wid is specified, the tip belongs to the status window
   of the currently active connection.

   A tip is closed if the window it belongs to is made active
   or is closed, or if mIRC is made active and the tip belongs
   to an MDI window.

85.Fixed /showmirc -nt bug minimizing mIRC but not activating
   the next application window.
86.Fixed $mp3() not handling Unicode tags correctly.

   used now.
96.Fixed editor "monitor file changes" bug with INI files.
97.When run under Vista mIRC now checks for a corresponding virtual
   store folder at startup. Vista creates virtual store folders for
   older non-Vista compatible applications, such as older versions
   of mIRC. If mIRC finds such a folder, it displays a dialog box
   allowing you to retrieve your old mIRC files and settings.
98.Added $sha1(text|&binvar|filename,[N]) identifier, where N = 0
   for plain text (default), 1 for &binvar, 2 for filename.
99.Updated to PNG 1.2.18 and PCRE v7.2 libraries and to OpenSSL
   0.9.8e support files.

    larger executable.
103.Added Mode menu item to the View menu in the menubar that allows
    you to switch between Normal and Compact modes. Compact mode

    main window, all windows opening on the desktop, and so on.

   uses various switchbar settings in the Options/Dialog.

   Right-clicking on an item pops up the usual system menu for that

    the line.
105.Fixed minimize option in DCC Send dialog not being applied
    immediately to current DCC send.

    auto tile section in Window/Group dialog.
107.Added /abook -wncl switches, open the different tabs in the
    address book dialog.

    nicknames in the Connect dialog remain static. Also added /mnick
    command to change your main nickname.
109.Added "Include desktop windows" to the Display dialog. If
    disabled, desktop windows are not displayed in the switchbar.

    extensions section is found in mirc.ini.
114.Extended SendMessage() support. The lParam value can now be used

    mapped filename is mIRCN. If lParam is zero, the filename is mIRC,
    as in previous versions.
115.Added "Auto" option to Switchbar lines setting in Options/Display
    dialog. Auto-expands switchbar as number of buttons changes when
    switchbar is in top/bottom position.

    To update properties for an existing button:

    -t = tooltip
    -p = picfile
    -l = alias
    -o = popup

    name = unique name assigned to button/separator, it cannot be
           a number

119.Fixed /!.var conversion to /set -l, was not using the !. prefixes.

    server connection attempts. "Clear History" via the servers list
    popup menu clears this list.
121.Fixed various multi-monitor right-click mouse button bugs.
122.Added /help and /winhelp support for .chm files.

46.Fixed SSL files path bug where certificate files where not being
   loaded if not in mIRC root folder.
47.Fixed :error handler bug where the normal break message was being
   displayed due to Control+Break being detected more than once.
48.Added support for display of UTF-8 text as Unicode in status,
   channel, query, and other windows, and in nickname listboxes,
   window titlebars, switchbar, and tooltips.

   The display of UTF-8 can be enabled for all windows in the
   Options/IRC/Messages dialog, or individually for each window
   via the Fonts dialog. The Fonts dialog also has an "Encode"
   option that encodes outgoing text in UTF-8 based on the
   script/codepage selected for that window.

   Note: The Encode feature is selective, ie. it only encodes the
   parts of an outgoing message that are not already in UTF-8 format.

   Added $utfencode(text, C) and $utfdecode(text, C), where C is the
   script/codepage ($window().fontcs) of the plain text.

   Added $isutf(text) identifier, returns UTF-8 status of text, where
   0 = not UTF-8 (contains invalid UTF-8 sequences), 1 = seems to be
   plain text, 2 = seems to contain valid UTF-8.

   Note: mIRC does not convert incoming UTF-8 into the local codepage.
   Server text is stored internally unchanged. This enables mIRC
   (scripts, etc.) to work fully with UTF-8 IRC servers that allow
   UTF-8 in channel and nick names.

73.Fixed invalid { parameter gpf bug in $eval, $height, $width,
   and $wrap identifiers.
74.Fixed while loop bug with :error and /reseterror.
75.Fixed various $comcall() bugs. The $comerr value is also now set
   when $comcall() calls the alias.

   Note: If $comcall() fails when calling an object and $com() does
   not, this means that the object is not compatible with mIRC's
   threading model, so $com() must be used.

76.Extended $findfile() to handle multiple file types separated by
   semi-colons, eg. *.exe;*.txt
77.Fixed display of Efnet numeric 338 containing IPv6 address.
78.Improved hotlink handling of bracket-enclosed channel names.

   the time value.
86.Fixed text-wrapping of messages for /fopen-related commands.
87./firewall command now also accepts server:port format.

    /timestamp -g switch to set logstamp format, and $logstamp and
    $logstampfmt identifiers.
104.Extended $sound() to read id3v2 tags, with properties .id3, .tags,
    and $sound(filename,N|name).tag. If you don't use .tag, it returns
    the id3v1 values.

    and fixed /flash making a sound even if -b or -w were not used.
106.Fixed DCC Send/Get window button/window sizing when different fonts
    are selected for the window.
107.Extended $input(text,kN), where kN is an N second timeout value.

    value if 'e' is specified, and $false otherwise.
108.Added custom dialog editbox 'number' property to limit input to
    numbers. Note that this only applies to typing in the editbox,
    not pasting.
109.Added /noop command, performs no operation.
110.Extended /showmirc -ntl, where -l locks mIRC when it is being
    minimized.
111.Added $regsubex([name], text, re, subtext), where subtext is
    evaluated during substitution and can be an identifier. Subtext
    can contain special markers where \0 = number of matches, \n =
    match number, \t = match text, \a = all match items. Returns text
    result.
112.Fixed "fill switchbar" display bug with /window -z windows.
113.Fixed parsing bug with combinations of $& and | separator.
114.Fixed /timer not checking for an invalid timer delay value.
115.Fixed /url not opening default browser in some situations.

                status window being closed is the cause of the
                disconnection.

      $activecid, and $lactivecid.

      $scid(N)[.command], where N is a $cid value
      $scon(N)[.command], where N is the Nth connection

      If N = 0, returns total number of open status windows.

      You can also specify a property which is a command name
      and it will be called using that server connection.

      /scid <-rsatM | N> [command], where N is a $cid value
      /scon <-rsatM | N> [command], where N is the Nth connection

      If you specify a command, the connection id is set only for
      that command. The -r switch resets the connection id to the
      original id for that script.

      The -a and -tM switches can only be used if you specify a
      command.

         -a - perform the command on all connection ids.

        -tM - where M is an or'd value of 1 = server connected,
              2 = not connected, 4 = connecting, 8 = not connecting.
              The command is only performed if N matches the connect
              status of the connection id.

      Note: if you use a command that contains $identifiers, and
      you want the identifiers to be evaluated in the target
      connection, you must pass them as $!identifier to prevent
      them from being evaulated first in the current connection.

    Also added new properties to $window():

      .type - returns window type name

    And to $query(), $window(), $chat(), $send(), $get(), $chan(),
    and $timer():

      .cid  - server connection id
      .wid  - window id
      .hwnd - window handle

    Added /server -mn switches, where -m creates a new server window
    and connects, -n creates new server window without connecting.

    Misc. notes:

    Windows whose server connection has been closed are placed
    at the end of the switchbar list. This includes things like
    DCC send/get/chat, and custom windows.

    Everything in mIRC now has a unique id number, all windows,
    server connections, DCC sends/get/chats, etc.

    The tray icon displays the animation for the current active
    server connection, same goes for the Connect toolbar button,
    and File menu.

    Each server connection has it's own /play list, and the play
    dialog shows the play list for the current active connection.

    Urls list "Send To" menu, and Tray popup menu, show the network
    and nickname for each status window.

177.Added /timer -i switch, makes a timer auto-associate with the
    currently active server connection.

    The -i switch keeps the /timer alive across server windows,
    if a server window is closed, the /timer just picks a new one
    automatically.

    /timer now shows the associated network name for a timer.

    You can use $timer().anysc to check if it has the -i switch
    enabled.

178.on PLAYEND is now triggered at the end of each played file.
179.Extended /ignore, /protect, etc. handling.

    Changed display format in Control dialog listbox.

    /ignore, /protect, /aop, and /avoice now all by default
    include a network name, unless you use the -w switch.

    /ignore -l now displays the unignore time.

    /ignore -l, when you're not connected to a server, lists all
    ignores. When connected, it lists all ignores that apply to
    that connection.

    Added .network property to $ignore()/$protect/$aop()/$avoice().

    Also note that isaop, isavoice, isignore, and isprotect all
    apply to the current connection.

180.Added /window switches:

    When a @window is created, it is automatically associated
    with the current connection. If that connection is closed,
    the @window is associated with the next available connection.

    You can change this behavior with /window -ivz:

    -i - makes a @window dynamically associate with the currently
         active connection. You can use $window().anysc to check
         if this setting is active.

    -v - closes window when associated status window is closed
         The on close event is triggered for the window.

         If this switch isn't used and the status window is
         closed, the @window is moved to the end of the switchbar,
         and is associated with the first available status window.

    -z - places window button at end of switchbar

181.The . prefix now makes /debug quiet. Extended /debug to allow
    output to a custom @window or filename.

    /debug [-cnpt] [N] [on | off | @window | filename]

    /debug -c off    closes associated @window
    /debug -n @moo   opens @window minimized
    /debug -pt       wrap or timestamp text
    /debug N @moo    use color N for text

    $debug returns name of debug file or @window.

    /debug now works independently for each server connection,
    indents lines if not wrapped, and prefixes each line with
    the server address, and <- and ->.

    /debug @window now also works with listbox @windows.

182.Active switchbar button now uses bold text and shaded background.
183.Using new path-splitting routines which affect eg. $nopath().
184.Auto-tile/cascade/arrange are no longer triggered when you close
    a desktop window.
185.Fixed switchbar/toolbar display glitch when mIRC window is sized
    to a very small height.
186.Fixed $findfile() bug when handling wildcards with numbers.
187.$chan is now filled for the on ctcpreply event if it was a channel
    ctcp message.
188.Ctcp messages that use an invalid format are now treated as plain
    text, and will trigger script events.
189.Added "Control+Tab uses switchbar order" to General dialog.

21.Fixed dir -b not displaying bytes in fileserver.
22.Added "Method" and "Notify list" options to Nick color list Add
   dialog.
23.mIRC now supports servers that send a /names list which contains
   a full nick!id@host format in the reply, enables mIRC to fill the
   IAL on joining a channel (no servers do this yet, so this hasn't
   been tested).
24.Fixed fserve max cps feature not being turned off if set to zero.
25.Fixed $rand() behavior.

   in /font, $width(), $height, $wrap(), /drawtext, /window, etc.
42.Fixed $readini() bug when used without the -n switch.
43.Added "Blink icons" option to Display dialog, blinks switchbar
   icons for channel/query windows if there's a message/highlight
   event, or a flash event.
44.Fixed !$identifier not prefix bug.
45.Fixed editbox bug in 16bit mIRC under win3.x.

47.Notify no longer triggers on a nick change if nick has only
   changed case.
48.Added "monitor file changes" option to Editor dialog.
49.$count() can now handle multiple substrings.
50.Added $+(n1,...,nN) identifier, combines parameters.
51.Added /hadd -uN, unsets item after N seconds, and /hsave -u, by
   default /hsave excludes items that are in the unset list, -u
   forces it to include the unset items.
52.Dcc Chat/Get windows are now re-used if they are inactive and the
   same person tries to chat with you again, or tries to re-send the
   same file.
53.Added back notify options to show address and time.
54.Extended Hash commands to allow storage of binary variables:

   /hadd -smbc <name> <item> [data | &binvar]

   The -b switch indicates that you're adding a &binvar item to the
   hash table, the -c switch chops the &binvar up to the first null
   and treats it as plain text.

   $hget(name/N,item, [&binvar])

   Assigns the result of a $hget() lookup to a &binvar.

   All other Hash commands handle binary variables as well, eg.
   /hload, /hsave, etc.

55.Fixed alias/script recursion gpf bug.
56.Added multibyte characters option to options/messages dialog.
57.Can now use /did -z name id [min max] to reset a scrollbar range in
   a custom dialog.

59.Fixed minimized icon and editbox bugs in 16bit mIRC.
60.Fixed /whois on query option not working in single message window.
61.Token identifiers can now be made case-sensitive by adding "cs" to
   the identifier name, eg. $addtokcs().
62./filter -g switch now treats wildcard text as a regex expression.
63.Added /aline and /iline -n switch, doesn't add line if it already
   exists in window.
64.Added two new variable types to $com(), dispatch and unknown.

   These allow you to pass dispatch/unknown pointers as parameters
   in a $com() call, or to retrieve dispatch/unknown pointers from
   a $com() call, by reference.

   To pass a dispatch/unknown pointer as a parameter in $com(),
   specify the variable type as dispatch/unknown, and specify the
   name of an existing $com() connection as the value.

   To retrieve a dispatch/unknown pointer through a call to $com(),
   specify the variable type as dispatch/unknown with *, and assign
   it a variable name. When $com() returns, mIRC will create a new
   $com() item with that variable name and assign it the dispatch
   or unknown pointer.

   In the case of retrieving an unknown pointer, mIRC will extend
   it to a dispatch pointer if it can, allowing you to call it
   directly via $com().

   You can use $com().dispatch or $com().unknown to see if a pointer
   exists for that $com() item.

65.mIRC now treats mode format +k * as a hidden key on all servers,
   for servers that hide the key from non-ops.
66.Fixed /dcc send -l max cps bug.
67.Added "mp3 playing" to confirm section in IRC options dialog.
68.Added on *:unload:/command event, triggers only in the script that
   is being unloaded. Also triggers if unloading via the Unload menu
   in the Editor dialog.

   You can use /unload -n to unload a script without triggering the
   on unload event.

69.Added history listbox to Control+F find dialog.
70.Added /timer -pr switches, pause and resume a timer.
71.mIRC now waits 30 seconds before a re-connect attempt if the server
   says that you were throttled for connecting too fast. mIRC looks for
   the word "throttled" in the ERROR Closing Link server message.
72.Fixed /ignore -uN not resetting nick color list colors when ignore
   removed after N seconds.
73.Fixed ignore button in DCC send/chat dialogs not working.
74.Fixed Flood protection ignore feature not working for DCCs.
75.Pressing the enter key in the Channels folder now joins a channel
   when you have an item selected in the listbox.
76.Fixed $abook() gpf bug.
77.Undo no longer works in a disabled editbox in a custom dialog.
78.Fixed drop event not working properly in custom dialogs.
79.Binary variables can now be 8192 bytes in length.
80.Added /filter -a switch, allows you to specify a sort alias which is
   called to sort the filtered lines.
81.Added /cline -m switch, makes mIRC color a nick in channel messages
   with the /cline color.

4.Log view dialog can now display large numbers of log files far
  more quickly.
5.The mIRC tray icon now displays the letter A for Active to
  indicate the active mIRC window, if you are running more than
  one mIRC at a time.
6.Fixed DCC Send/Get cps calculation display.
7.Fixed function key focus bug while in channel windows.
8.Added /echo -m switch, indicates that the line should be
  processed as a user message instead of an event.
9.Fixed line marker being lost if lines in a window exceeded max
  line buffer size.
10.Agent support no longer strips out high-ascii characters used
   in non-english languages.
11.Fixed tray icon refresh bug.
12.Fixed custom dialog display bug, controls weren't being re-
   displayed properly in some situations.
13.Added Hide channel key option to IRC dialog.
14.Fixed /play -e not working with custom windows.

   it back into seconds, and if N == 2 returns format without
   seconds.
16.Fixed line marker bug, was being set inbetween lines in some
   situations.
17.Log view dialog now maintains cursor position in listbox after
   you delete or merge files.
18.Added on 1:APPACTIVE:echo $appactive event, triggers when the
   mIRC active application state changes. $appactive is $true if
   any mIRC window is active.

   Also added on 1:ACTIVE:@#?=!*:echo $active $lactive event,
   triggers when a window in mIRC is activated. $lactive returns
   the previously active window. If the previous window is no
   longer open, $lactive returns $null.

19.Added on 1:AGENT:echo $agentname finished speaking! event.
20.Added new DDE Topic, EVALUATE, makes mIRC evaluate identifiers
   or variables in a line of text.
21.Added 'auto-minimize on join' option to channels folder edit
   dialog.
22.Control section in Options dialog has been moved to the Address
   Book dialog, and has been improved.
23.Added /ignore -d switch, ignores DCCs such as Sends/Chat/etc.,
   /ignore -t ctcp no longer ignores DCCs.
24.Added auto-voice list to Control dialog.

   Changed /auto command to /aop, isauto to isaop, $auto to $aop,
   the old formats are still supported for now.

   Added /avoice command, isavoice if comparison, and $avoice.

   Added identifiers $aop(address/N), $avoice(address/N), and
   $protect(address/N), all with .type property.

25.Channels which are auto-joined on an invite are now minimized
   on join.
26.Added Options section to IRC dialog with default flash settings
   for channel/query windows, and mIRC exit confirmation options.
27.Extended /flash to /flash [-wbrN] [window] <text> which allows
   you to flash the desktop icon of any open mIRC window including
   custom windows.
28.Can now specify a titlebar icon for a custom dialog using
   icon filename, index
29.Scrollbars can now handle up to 64000 lines in a window.
30.Fixed $timer().secs bug.
31.Changed max cps method in fileserver, now represents total max
   cps for all DCC sends combined. This also limits DCC sends
   initiated with /dcc send -l. If you use /dcc send -l0 this
   prevents a script-initiated DCC send from being limited.
32./ignore /aop /avoice /protect now allow you to properly remove
   #channels one by one with -r.
33.Added agent dialog speech option to avoid repeating channel
   name in channel messages/actions.
34.Can now use SendMessage() to communicate with 32bit mIRC:

   SendMessage(mHwnd, WM_MCOMMAND, cMethod, 0L)

   mHwnd         mIRC window, or Channel/Query/etc. window
   WM_MCOMMAND   WM_USER + 200
   cMethod       1 - As if typed in editbox
                 2 - As if typed in editbox, send as plain text
                 4 - Use flood protection if turned on
                     Can be or'd with 1 or 2
   Returns       0 if fails, 1 if successful

   SendMessage(mHwnd, WM_MEVALUATE, 0, 0L)

   mHwnd         mIRC window, or Channel/Query/etc. window
   WM_MEVALUATE  WM_USER + 201
   Returns       0 if fails, 1 if successful

   The application that sends these messages should create a
   mapped file named "mIRC" with CreateFileMapping(). When mIRC
   receives the above messages, it will open this file and use
   the data it contains to perform the command or evaluation.

   In the case of an evaluation, mIRC will output the results
   to the mapped file.

   The mapped file must be at least 1024 bytes in length.

35.Added Position Default Save/Forget menu items to system menu
   for Channel and Query/Chat windows.
36.Auto-tile/cascade no longer trigger if a window is opened in
   a minimized state.
37.mIRC now supports the numeric 005 tokens: CHANTYPES=# and
   PREFIX=(ohv)@%+ and can handle a dynamic set of channel and
   nick prefixes.

   mIRC assumes that @ is supported on all networks, any mode
   left of @ is assumed to have at least equal power to @, and
   any mode right of @ has less power.

   mIRC has internal support for @%+ modes.

   $nick() can now handle all mode letters listed in PREFIX.

   Also added support for CHANMODES=A,B,C,D token (not currently
   supported by any servers), which lists all modes supported
   by a channel, where:

     A = modes that take a parameter, and add or remove nicks
         or addresses to a list, such as +bIe for the ban,
         invite, and exception lists.

     B = modes that change channel settings, but which take
         a parameter when they are set and unset, such as
         +k key, and -k key.

     C = modes that change channel settings, but which take
         a parameter only when they are set, such as +l N,
         and -l.

     D = modes that change channel settings, such as +imnpst
         and take no parameters.

   All unknown/unlisted modes are treated as type D.

   When not connected to a server, mIRC uses default values
   of CHANTYPES=#& PREFIX=(ohv)@%+ CHANMODES=bIe,k,l

   Also added identifiers $chantypes $prefix $chanmodes.

   Notes:

   1. mIRC doesn't support @ or $ as a channel prefix, or $ as
      a nickname prefix, these are used internally by mIRC.

   2. Ircd coders should be aware that prefixes can change
      the way an IRC client behaves.

      eg. If a server uses the same prefixes for channels and
      nicknames, this could cause certain features in mIRC
      to behave oddly, eg. scripts, hotlinks, tab completion,
      etc. which, depending on the prefix, provide a different
      behavior or interface in non-context situations.

38.Added support for the numeric 005 token: MODES=N where N is
   the number of items allowed per /mode change. Added $modespl
   identifier.
39.Fixed server port not being randomly selected on each new
   connection.
40.Fixed treelist in options dialog not scrolling to selected
   item in some situations when options dialog is opened.
41.Fixed local info server lookup bug, was failing if the irc
   server returned an ip address in a /userhost reply.
42.Added $var(%var,N) returns Nth matching variable name. You can
   use a wildcard for the variable name. If N is zero, returns
   total number of matching variable names. This searches both
   local and global variables. $var().value returns the value of
   the variable, $var().local returns $true/$false.
43.Added $rgb() 3dlight value.
44.Added support for numeric 005 WALLCHOPS token, mIRC will use
   /NOTICE @<channel> :<text> if this token is set, instead of
   using multiple targets.
45.DCC Get no longer offers resume option if incoming filesize
   is smaller than existing file.
46.$window().state and .icon return values for -2 now.
47.Fixed handling of /msg +#channel messages.
48.Changed behavior of Notify dialog, no longer changes Add
   button to Update. When you edit an item it is automatically
   updated.
49.Fixed bug in DNS routine, might have caused a gpf in some
   cases where the address didn't resolve.
50.Added 'Show All' menu item to notify window popup menu.
51.Added 'Grayed text' item to Colours dialog, used to gray nicks
   in notify list.
52.The protect list in control dialog can now protect a full
   nick!user@host address by using the IAL. The address can use
   wildcards.
53.Added 'Position' menu to System menu of all windows.
54.Can now set a @window icon with /window @ iconfile [N].
55.Script editor editbox can now handle 64k of text in 32bit mIRC.
56.Added $uptime(mirc | server | system, N) returns uptime in
   milli-seconds for specified item. N is optional, if N = 1 it
   returns the same format as $duration(), if N = 2 returns same
   format but without seconds, and N = 3 returns seconds instead
   of milli-seconds.
57.Added $regex([name], text, re) to parse regular expressions.
   Returns N number of strings matched.

   The list of strings for a match are referenced through
   $regbr([name], N), N = 0 returns total number of strings.

   $regbr([name], N).pos returns a strings position in text.

   $regbr() remembers the results for up to 10 names. Each time
   you do a match with $regex(), and you specify a name, that
   name's previous results are overwritten with the new results.

   $regsub([name], text, re, subtext, %var) same as $regex() but
   performs a substitution, returns N number of substitutions
   performed, and assigns result to variable %var.

   If you don't specify a name, all identifiers use a default
   name which is overwritten with each call.

   Note: mIRC uses the PCRE library (www.pcre.org)

58.Fixed bug in $ctime() wasn't handling certain date formats.
59.Added support for ! not prefix in if statements for use with
   $identifiers and %variables, eg. if (!%moo) echo no cows
60.Added nick colors section to address book, allows you to assign
   colors to a nick/address which is used to color the nick in
   messages and in the channel nick list.

   The /cnick command allows you to add or remove items from
   the colour list:

     /cnick -raniovp [nick[!user@host]] [color] [modes] [levels]

   You can use /cnick -r nick/N to remove first item that matches

     member - member name.

     method - Combination of the following values added together:

              double, integer, long, single, string, variant.

              To make a variable by reference, use * in the type
              name, eg. i1*

              To assign a name to a variable for later reference
              after a call, append it to the type, eg. i1* varname

              When using a variant you must also specify the variable
              type after it, eg. variant bool.

     value  - the value assigned to the variable type.

     Returns: 1 = ok, 0 = fail.

   After you've opened a COM connection or made a call to $com() you
   can use the following forms of $com():

   $com(name/N)

     Returns: name if connection is open, or name of Nth connection.
              N = 0 returns number of open connections.

                the call.

       error  - error value, if there was an error.

       errortext - error description associated with error.

       argerr - Nth argument that caused the error, if the error

49.Added $scriptline, returns current script line number.
50.Fixed bug with Order dialog in Editor when ordering scripts.
51.Improved support for DLLs via /dll and $dll().

   You can now keep a DLL loaded by including a LoadDll() routine
   in your DLL, which mIRC calls the first time you load the DLL:

     void __declspec(dllexport) __stdcall (*LoadDll)(LOADINFO*);

     typedef struct {
       DWORD  mVersion;
       HWND   mHwnd;
       BOOL   mKeep;
     } LOADINFO;

     mVersion contains the mIRC version number in the low and high
     words.

     mHwnd contains the window handle to the main mIRC window.

     mKeep is set to TRUE by default, indicating that mIRC will keep
     the DLL loaded after the call. You can set mKeep to FALSE to
     make mIRC unload the DLL after the call (which is how previous
     mIRCs worked).

   You can unload a loaded DLL by using:

     /dll -u <filename>

     $dll(N/filename) returns the list of loaded DLLs.

   You can also define an UnloadDll() routine in your DLL which
   mIRC will call when unloading the DLL to allow it to clean up.

   mIRC will automatically unload a DLL if it is not used for ten
   minutes, or when mIRC exits, UnloadDll() will also be called
   in these situations:

     int __declspec(dllexport) __stdcall (*UnloadDll)(int mTimeout);

     The mTimeout value can be:

     0   UnloadDll() is being called due to a DLL being unloaded
         when mIRC exits, or unloaded with /dll -u.

     1   UnloadDll() is being called due to a DLL not being used for
         ten minutes. The UnloadDll() routine can return 0 to keep
         the DLL loaded, or 1 to allow it to be unloaded.

52.mIRC will now properly parse server messages that aren't prefixed
   with a server address, and will use the server address prefix in
   numeric 001 for such non-prefixed messages.
53.Fixed bug in flood protection feature.
54.Nick changes now update nick in query window titlebars.
55.Added $server().pass property for server password.
56.Added /echo -n switch, prevents /echo from hiliting switchbar

63.Added /filter -b key, strips BURK codes when matching text.
64.Added $onpoly(n1,n2,x,y,x,y,...), checks if two polygons are
   overlapped, returns $true/$false. n1 is the number of points for
   the first polygon, n2 is for the second polygon.
65.Added $bvar(&var,N).word,nword,long,nlong, returns values in host
   and network byte order.
66.Fixed bug in $isalias() not recognizing local -l aliases when
   called from the local script.
67./splay now supports .mp3 files, also added on MP3END event,
   $inmp3, and $mp3dir (folder can be specified in Sound requests
   dialog).

   Added $mp3(filename) identifier, with properties: album, title,
   artist, year, comment, genre, track, length, version, bitrate,
   variable, sample, mode, copyright, private, crc.

   The /splay command has also been extended to:

   /splay -wmpq [filename | stop | pause | resume | seek | skip] [pos]

   Where w = wave, m = midi, p = mp3, and q = queue for playing.

   If you specify [pos] value when playing an mp3, mIRC will play
   from that position, eg. /splay ipanema.mp3 1000

   You can seek to a position in an mp3 while it's being played with
   eg. /splay seek 1000

   You can skip the currently playing sound with /splay [-wmp] skip

   Extended $inwave, $inmidi, and $inmp3, with properties .fname,
   .pos, .length, eg. $inmp3.pos

   You can use the /vol -wmpvuN [volume] command to set the volume on
   your system for waves, midis, mp3s (same as waves), or -v which
   sets the master volume, range 0 to 65000. The -uN switch sets the
   mute, where N = 1 is on, N = 2 is off.

   You can use $vol(wave|midi|mp3|master) to get the current volume,
   and $vol().mute returns the mute setting.

68.Changed behavior of on HOTLINK event, /halt in one script will
   no longer affect the event in a following script.
69.Extended $os to detect ME.
70.Added test button to agent lexicon dialog.
71.Can now use N = 0 in $did(name,id,N) to access the edit control
   in a combobox, and N = 0 in /did to modify it.

73.Fixed /play -b requiring delay value, now uses default if none
   specified.

   optional.
75.Added $wrap(text, font, size, width, [word,] N), returns Nth line
   wrapped to width. If optional word parameter is 1, text is wrapped
   at whole words (default).
76.Improved handling of \\network paths. mIRC can now also be run
   from a network path and will correctly use that path as root for
   INI files, folders, etc.
77.Channel central now enables Op settings for IRCops.
78.Identifiers called in popup menu titles can now use $1- to refer
   to the selected listbox item.

80.Fixed /close bug, wasn't closing multiple sends/etc. properly.
81.Added /drawpic -l switch, tiles picture in specified area.
82.Added $keychar to on keyup/keydown events, returns the actual
   character being pressed as opposed to the key code.
83.Editor now defaults to last used folder when displaying the load
   file dialog.
84.The D parameter in $round(N,D) is now optional.
85.Added identifiers to encode/decode %vars or &binvars:

     $encode(%var | &binvar, mubt, N)
     $decode(%var | &binvar, mubt, N)

   The last two parameters are optional.

   The second parameter consists of switches, where m = mime,
   u = uucode (default), b = &binvar, and t = text (default).

   The final encoded line is made up of 60-character chunks.
   You can specify N if you want mIRC to return the Nth chunk.
   N = 0 returns the total number of chunks in the line.

   If encoding/decoding a &binvar, the identifiers return the
   actual number of characters written to the &binvar.

   Encoding uses 33% more storage space.

86./query now displays address in titlebar if user is in IAL. The
   Message window now also displays the address in the titlebar for
   the last received message.
87.Selecting a server in the connect dialog now makes it the default
   server even if you press the OK button in another section of the
   options dialog.

97.Added $window().hwnd and $dialog().hwnd property.
98.Added $window().icon, returns "on" or "off" depending on whether
   a window icon is visible. Note that $window().state no longer
   replies with "hidden".
99.Custom windows can now be logged, "logging" item in system menu.
100.$ulist(*,N) now returns all matches in user list including just
    nickname entries.

    the desktop.
103.Added "include network" switch in logging dialog, includes name
    of network in log filename.

113.Development notes: mIRC 32bit in future may not work under win32s
    win3.1. This will allow me to support new technologies in the
    32bit. mIRC 16bit may continue to be developed, with bugfixes,
    where possible.
114.Fixed $findfile() bug, if full path wasn't being specified may
    not have worked.
115.Added /set -n switch, treats following values as plain text
    instead of a calculation.
116.Added $nick().pnick property, returns .@%+nick format.
117.Added $remote, returns ctcp/event/raw on/off status or'd together,

118.Fixed resource leak in DCC Send/Get windows display.
119.New channel central dialog, made display of banlist info  clearer,
    and now shows related auto-unban info. Also added Edit button,
    allows editing of an address.
120.Added /timer -h switch, creates a multimedia timer. Only works in
    32bit mIRC. Also added $timer().mmt property.

    Since multimedia timers are a scarce resource, and cpu intensive,
    mIRC allocates one multimedia timer and uses it for all of your
    -h timers. In order to keep cpu usage down to a minimum, the
    delay of this timer is dynamically changed as /timers are created
    or destroyed so as to use the lowest common denominator delay.

    The moment you don't have any -h timers running, mIRC frees the
    multimedia timer. If mIRC is unable to allocate a multimedia
    timer, it uses the normal /timer -m millisecond timer.

121.Made changes to mouse leave event, should work better when used
    for drag events.
122.Channel nicklist and IAL routines now use hashtable lookups to
    speed processing.

    mIRC while the editor dialog is open.
124.Fixed /window command not handling floating point values for
    x y w h paramters.
125.mIRC can now be run as a service under 95/98 by specifying
    -service on the shortcut command line.
126.Custom window menu/mouse events now process the script which
    created the /window before looking through other scripts.
127.Fixed bug in $dbuw and $dbuh not returning the correct values.
128.Added hash table support for scripting. A hash table can be
    created/destroyed/modified using:

      /hmake <name> <N>           -  create a new hash table size N
      /hfree <name>               -  destroy an existing hash table

      /hadd <name> <item> <data>  -  add an item
      /hdel <name> <item>         -  delete an item

    You can use -s with all commands to show output, and -w with
    /hfree and /hdel to make them treat the name or item as a wildcard
    to free all matching items.

    A hash table can store an unlimited number of items regardless
    of the N size you choose, however the bigger N is the faster it
    will work, depending on the number of items stored.

      /hload <name> <filename>    -  load table from a file
      /hsave <name> <filename>    -  save table to a file

    By default, these load/save plain text to a text file, with item
    and data on separate lines ($cr and $lf characters are stripped
    from text before saving). You can use -b to load/save binary files.
    You can also use -n to make them load/saves files as data only,
    with no items.

    /hsave also supports -o to overwite an existing file, and -a to
    append to an existing file.

    To reference the contents of a hash table, you can use:    

      $hget(name/N)        -  returns name of a hash table if it exists,
                              or returns the name of the Nth hash table.
                             .size property returns the size of table

      $hget(name/N,item)   -  returns the data associated with an item

    You can also reference the table as an index from 0 to N using
    $hget(name/N,N).item which returns the Nth item name in the table.
    If N is zero, returns the total number of items in the table. This
    method is provided as a convenience, it is not an efficient way to
    use the hash table.

    Note: the hash table is case-insensitive.

129.Changed $ial(mask,N) to make N optional (defaults to 1), and mask
    can now be just a nickname.
130.Can now use $did().seltext on a listbox/combobox to return the text
    of the first selected item.
131.Fixed $isdir() bug.
132.Added "Save and Log As" item to system menu, allows saving buffer
    and starting a log in one selection.
133.Fixed hotlink bug on ircx servers with .nick owner prefix.
134.mIRC no longer splits logs at midnight for chats, it only does this
    for channel logs now.
135.All matching mouse events in custom window menus are triggered now,
    previously mIRC was only triggering the first matching event and
    ignoring all remaining scripts.
136.Fixed DCC chat bug, initiating a DCC chat from behind a firewall
    wasn't working properly.
137.Fixed notify list focus bug.
138.mIRC now uses the "start in" folder in a shortcut icon as the
    root folder. Can override with -r command line switch.
139.Added $notify().addr property, works on watch-enabled ircds.
140.Fixed DCC send/get/chat time-out gpf bug.

   /gopts -n <name> <langid> where langid is the hex id value.
38.DCC chat send/recv errors now trigger the on close event.
39.Fixed +e handling on Conference Room servers which use +e as a
   channel mode, not as the exception list mode as on IRCnet.

50.Fixed page up/down scrolling too far when using paragraph line
   spacing.
51.Fixed switchbar display for time-out DCC sends/gets.
52.mIRC now maintains an internal banlist for each channel. Added
   $chan().banlist, returns $true if mode +b has been seen already,
   or $false if not, or $inmode if currently in a mode +b listing.

   Added $banlist(#channel,N) identifier, returns Nth item, or if N
   is 0 returns total number of items in list. $banlist().by returns
   the address of the user who set the ban, and $banlist().date
   returns the date.

   Note: this feature does not work on ircx servers.

53.The isop comparison now evalutes to true if a nick is an owner on
   ircx servers.
54.Added support for menus in custom dialogs:

   dialog name {
     menu "text", <menuid> [, menuid]
     item "text", <id> [, menuid]
     item break, <id> [, menuid]
   }

   If you don't specify a [menuid] for an item, it will use the last
   menuid that was created/used in a previous menu/item.

   on 1:dialog:name:menu:*:{
     echo 5 $dname $devent $did
   }

   You can use /did -ebcuadio to enable/disable, check/uncheck, append,
   delete, insert, and overwrite a menu item.

   To add an item to a menu you can use: /did -a name <menuid> <newid>
   <text>.

   To insert an item you must use: /did -i name <id> <newid> <text>
   where <id> is the item before which you want to insert an item.

   Note: You can use the text "break" to refer to a break item in the
   /did command.

   text, and -u uses the speech settings, ie. pitch, volume, the
   increase speed setting, etc.

   /gload -h and /gopts -h <on | off> switch, makes mIRC hide the
   agent when mIRC is minimized. Also added $agent().hide property.

   to prevent them from popping the agent when mIRC is minimized
   and has the -h setting.

71.Added /loadbuf -r switch, resets contents of window.
72.Fixed bug in /ignore /auto /protect, if you used -r to remove an

   situations.
87.Added /showmirc -op switches, -o sets mIRC on top, -p removes

   $did().seltext    returns selected text in an editbox
   $did().selstart   returns select start character in editbox line
   $did().selend     returns select end character in editbox line

   /did -c name id [n] [start [end]]

   optional parameters n = numeric sort, c = channel nick prefix sort,
   r = reverse sort.

   works when you are replacing text.
40.Added $ini(file,topic/N,item/N), where item/N is optional, and can

   use /break to break out of the current loop. You can also use the
   /continue command to jump to the beginning of the loop.

   var %i = 1
   while (%i <= 10) {
     echo 2 %i
     inc %i
     if (%i > 5) break
   }

   custom dialog when outputting to it.
56.$numtok(text,C) now returns zero if text is empty.
57./if comparions now handle $null values properly. In the case of
   a string comparison $null is treated as an empty string. In the

   the comparison fails.
58.Added $send().secs and $get().secs, returns number of seconds
   that the connection has been open.
59.Added "max cps per user" option to Options/fserve dialog. Allows
   you to limit max cps used by a DCC send to a user in a fileserver.
   This is also applied to /dcc sends initiated in a remote script.

   You can override this by using /dcc send -lN switch, limits
   transfer speed for a DCC send to N cps. If you specify zero, no
   limit is applied.

   The /dcc maxcps <N> command can be used to changed the Max Cps
   value on the fly.

   listbox for normal messages, the highlight listbox for messages
   that match your highlight settings.

   selection is stored along with the normal font info in mirc.ini.
76.Added support for Microsoft Agent in mIRC 32bit under win95 or
   greater. I downloaded all of the files on:

     http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/imedia/agent/agentdl.asp

   /gload <name> <filename | N | default>
   /gunload <name>

   /gshow <name> [x y]
   /ghide <name>

   /gmove <name> <x> <y> [speed]
   /gsize <name> <w> <h>

   /gtalk -kw <name> <text | <wavefile | text>>
          -k   - think text
          -w   - play wave file

   /gplay <name> <animname | N> [timeout]
   /gpoint <name> <x y>

   /gstop -c <name> [talk play]
          -c   - stops only the current anim/talk instead of all

   /gopts -bieq <name> <on off size pace hide>
          -b   - balloons: <on size pace hide | off>
          -i   - idle effects: <on off>
          -e   - sound effects: <on off>

   /gqreq <on off>
          - turns queuing of messages on or off, default on.

   $agentver   - returns Agent version, 0 if not installed
   $agentstat  - returns 1 if Agent ready, or 0 if busy/speaking

   $agent(name).name, fname, visible, x, y, w, h, ow, oh,
                speed, pitch, idle, effects, active, langid,
                balloon

   name    - the name you gave to this agent
   fname   - the filename of the agent, ie. merlin.acs, or "default"
             if you didn't specify a filename
   visible - returns $true or $false
   x,y,w,h - left/top position, width/height.
   ow, oh  - original width/height
   speed   - speaking speed
   pitch   - speaking pitch
   idle    - if idle behavior is on or off
   effects - if sound effects are on or off
   active  - if this agent is active/topmost
   langid  - language id of system
   balloon - current setting: on off size pace hide

   $agent(N).char

   char    - returns filename of Nth available agent, if you specify 0
             returns total number of installed agents.

   $agent(name,N).anim, line

   anim    - returns the names of the animations available for playing
             for this agent. If you specify 0, returns the total number
             of animations. If you specify N, returns the name of the
             Nth animation.

   line    - returns the list of lines currently queued to be spoken
             for this character. If you specify 0, returns total number
             of queued lines. If you specify N, returns the Nth line.

   You can also use tags in /gtalk in <text> which may be recognized by
   the text-to-speech engine, these are a few:

   \spd=nnn\      - set speed of spoken text
   \pit=nnn\      - set pitch of spoken text
   \vol=nnn\      - set volume of spoken text
   \chr="string"\ - where string is normal, monotone, or whisper
   \ctx="string"\ - address, email, unknown
   \emp\          - emphasize next word
   \pau=nnn\      - pause speech nnn milliseconds
   \rst\          - reset settings to default

   $notags(text)  - removes the above tags from text, but only if the
                    tags are correctly written as above.

   Notes:
   1. mIRC queues all requests and plays them one after the other
      to ensure that even if you use multiple agents at the same
      time, all messages will be heard, and all agents will act in
      the order that you requested.

      You can turn queuing on/off using /gqreq <on | off> on the
      fly.

   2. You can't load more than one of the same agent, ie. if you
      load Genie, you can't load a second Genie. You can however
      load Genie, Merlin, Peedy, and any other custom characters
      all at the same time.

   3. Looping animations prevent an agent from doing anything else
      until you /gstop the agent. The [timeout] value in /gplay
      allows you to specify a maximum time-limit for an animation
      after which it is automatically stopped, and the agent will
      then perform the remaining queued requests. If you don't
      specify a timeout value, the default is 5 seconds. If no
      play or talk requests are pending, the looping animation
      continues beyond the timeout until there are.

77.The $filename identifier can now be used in the on PLAYEND event
   to refer to the filename that was just played.
78.Added .logfile property to $chan(), $chat(), $query(), and
   $window(), returns logfile name if a log is open for the window,
   otherwise returns $null.
79.Changed channel central dialog, uses a tabbed dialog, and adds
   support for the +e and +I IRCnet channel modes. Also added a
   display section for redirecting channels events.
80.If you have Speech Recognition (SR) software installed, mIRC can
   be made to listen to voice commands by using:

     /vcmd -lc <on | off | sleep>
           -c      - clears the command list
           -l      - lists current commands
           sleep   - ignores commands temporarily

     /vcadd <command1,command2,...>
     /vcrem <command1,command2,...>

   If the SR software matches a word you've spoken to a word in your
   commands list, mIRC triggers the VCMD event:

     on 1:VCMD:<matchtext>:<*/#/?/@>:/echo 3 Recognized: $1-

   The $vcmd(N) identifier returns the Nth item in the voice commands
   list.

   $vcmdver  - returns version of SR software, $null if not installed

   $vcmdstat - returns 0 not available
                       1 currently off
                       2 ignoring commands
                       3 listening

   Notes:
   1. Your SR software may have very large speech files/dictionaries,
      it could take 10 or more seconds for your SR software to load
      or unload, and may be slow while processing your speech, causing
      short pauses in mIRC.
   2. Adding or removing commands can be done on the fly, however if
      your SR software is slow at updating the commands list, mIRC
      has to wait until it finishes.

81.Fixed custom dialogs DBU bug in dialog "size" item, was creating
   dialogs that were 10 or so pixels taller than they should be.
82.If a new window opens while you are in a dialog, eg. script editor,
   the new window no longer takes away the focus from the dialog.

   If you want to force a custom window to take focus, you can use the
   /window -a switch when creating the window.

83.The message highlight section in the Options/IRC dialog now matches
   against whole words, or words enclosed in non-alphabetic characters.
   You can use wildcards *? to make a word match non-whole words.
84./unset now evaluates variables inside [] brackets, this allows you to
   unset variables with dynamically created names:

   test  {
     set %a [ $+ b ] 1
     set %a [ $+ c ] 2
     set %a [ $+ d ] 3
     unset %a [ $+ b ] %a [ $+ c ] %a [ $+ d ]
   }

85./part can now close an open channel window while not connected.
87.Changed behavior of /disconnect and /quit, can now cancel a connect
   in progress.
88.You can now remove a nick from your Tab Key list with Control-D.
89.Added $mklogfn(filename) identifier, returns the filename format that
   the logging feature uses, $mknickfn(nickname) fixes a nickname for use
   as a filename, and $mkfn(filename), removes invalid characters.
90.You can now prevent a command from being processed as an alias by
   prefixing it with a ! character, eg. /!command etc.
91.Added event: on 1:PONG:echo pong reply: $1-, note: you can't use this
   to intercept /pings to your own nickname, this is used internally by
   mIRC.
92.Can now use $editbox(=name) for DCC chat editboxes.
93.Fixed a bug in sclick event for comboboxes in custom dialogs.
94.Made a change to the way sockets are closed throught-out mIRC.
95.Fixed bug in /did command causing hidden controls to become visible.
96.The "photo" display method of background pictures can now display
   pictures properly regardless of their height/width ratio.

   is now fixed.
98.Added .stamp property to $chan(), $chat(), $query(), and $window(),
   returns timestamp setting.
99.Added $dbuw and $dbuh, return dbu per pixel width and height.
100.Changed parsing method for most identifiers so that your custom
    identifiers will now work even if they begin with the same letters
    as internal identifiers.

    Directory related identifiers have not been updated, eg. $mircdir,
    $getdir, $cd, etc. since many widely used scripts append text
    directly to them, ie.:

      //splay $file="Select wave:" $mircdirsounds\

    Instead of using the (better) format:

      //splay $file="Select wave:" $mircdir $+ sounds\

101.Removed support for the very old $parm and *N identifiers.
102.Fixed bug in /drawrect, sizing was slightly off. You can now
    also specify negative values for the width/height.
103.Extended "Date filenames" feature to allow you to date filenames
    by day, week, or month. If dated by week, log files begin on days
    1, 7, 14, and 21, and if dated by month, they begin on day 1.
104.Added support for single/double/paragraph line spacing in windows,
    can set default in Options/Display section, and for each window
    via the system menu.
105.Fixed bug in socket-related routines which may have affected IRC
    server connection, DCC Send/Get, and Custom sockets.
106.Changing the MDI/desktop setting of a window no longer makes mIRC
    forget the previously saved window position.
107.Fixed bug where mIRC was leaving tmpN.$$$ files in mIRC directory
    in certain situations.
108.Can now stop a /list on Undernet servers by selecting the "stop
    listing" item in the Channels List window menu.
109.Hotlink feature should be a bit smarter when matching nicknames
    to a link now.
110.Extended $os to detect 2000.
111.mIRC now re-adds its icon to the tray if the tray is restarted.
112.Added "copy messages to query" option in IRC dialog; if you're
    talking to a user in the dedicated message window and then decide
    to open a query to them, this copies the conversation you've had
    so far from the dedicated message window to the query window.
113.Can now specify a negative index in token identifiers, eg.

    //echo $puttok(a b c d, e, -2, 32)  =  a b e d
    //echo $instok(a b c d, e, -2, 32)  =  a b c e d
    //echo $deltok(a b c d, -2, 32)     =  a b d

114.$len() now returns 0 if passed an empty value.
115.Added $base(N,inbase,outbase,zeropad,precision) to convert number
    N from inbase to outbase. The last two parameters are optional.
116.Added $bfind(&binvar, N, M), searches a &binvar for a matching
    value, starting from position N. M can be a character value, ie.
    0 to 255, or text. The search is case-insensitive.

    $bfind(&test, 1, mirc)     finds "mirc" starting from pos 1
    $bfind(&test, 5, 32)       finds char 32 (a space) from pos 5
    $bfind(&test, 1, 87 65 86) finds WAV from pos 1

    You can use $bfind().text to force a text search if the search
    text is a number.
117.Sockets now have the "keep alive" setting turned on which should
    help keep a connection alive over extended periods.
118.Ctcp messages are now time-stamped.
119.$date now returns the full four-digit year. $ctime now also assumes
    the year 2000 if you specify a year <= 38.
120.$menu now works in mouse events in menu {} definitions.
121.Added "hide ping? pong!" option to IRC dialog.
122.Windows can now have their own timestamp setting independent of the
    global timestamp setting in the IRC/Messages dialog.

    global setting.

    You can also set the timestamp format using /timestamp -f [format].

123.Hotlinks now work on Tab-key nicknames that have messaged you in
    the message window.

    only in 32bit mIRC.
127.Added /bcopy [-zc] <&binvar> <N> <&binvar> <S> <M>

    This copies M bytes from position S in the second &binvar to
    the first &binvar at position N. This can also be used to copy
    overlapping parts of a &binvar to itself. If M = -1, all of
    the bytes from position S onwards are copied.

    If you specify the -z switch, the bytes in the source &binvar
    that were copied are zero-filled after the copy.

    If you specify the -c switch, the first &binvar is chopped to
    length N + M.

    Also added /bunset <&binvar> ... <&binvar> command to unset the
    specified list of &binvars.

  If you have a large notify list, the notify list will now work
  on IRCX servers, a maximum of 30 nicknames at a time are sent
  in the ISON request.

  The "raw" event can now trap all events that mIRC doesn't
  internally recognize, so IRCX events can be processed, eg.:

  raw prop:*:echo 4 PROP: $nick $address $event $1-

  The DATA event from microsoft chat clients is now hidden, and
  any privmsgs of the format :(#G2<:E:10M1) or :(#G810E21:RM1)
  are trimmed to the text after this token. This is only done
  on IRCX servers.

  mIRC now sees the CREATE event, interprets it as a JOIN, and
  also displays the KNOCK, EVENT, and WHISPER events.

  The PROP TOPIC event now updates the topic in a channel window
  titlebar.

  The +dhuwx channel modes are now displayed in the titlebar.

  channel in the limit channels list, or you can specify a channel
  name instead of N.
10.Added "show in channel: ctcps" switch to IRC dialog, to display
   ctcps sent to a channel in the channel window.

27.Extended $chat/$fserv/$send/$get, to $chat(nick,N), $fserv(nick,N),
   $send(nick,N) and $get(nick,N) for nicks with mutliple DCC sessions
   open. The old format of $xxx(nick/N) is still supported.

   Also extended /close -cfsg to allow you to specify Nth chat/fserv/

   LFN with the /sound command.
36.Made a change in the way mIRC submits /list *wildcard* on the new
   DALnet servers, the method mIRC was using before wasn't being
   recognized, so the entire channels list was being sent.
37.The Find dialog in the Editor now remembers past searches.
38.Fixed bug in /writeini and $readini relating to items prefixed
   with [, windows writes multiple items of the same name in this

42.Added custom dialog {} item "option" with properties "dbu" and
   "pixels", allows you to specify whether the dialog uses dialog base
   units for measuring control sizes and dialog width/height.

   Using dialog base units ensures that your dialog will appear the
   same size for all users on any size display etc.

   Also added /dialog -bp switch, indicates that the width/height is
   in dialog based units or pixel units.

43.$fline() now strips BURC codes from the text before tying to
   find a match.
44./did -g no longer makes an icon visible if it was hidden before.
45.$did().visible now works properly for icons.
46.$did() on an icon now returns the index and filename of the icon.
47.Fixed bug in drag-drop onto channel nick listbox.
48.Fixed bug with "always get..." switches being turned off in
   some situations.
49.Improved hotlinks to recognize %#channels only on ircx servers,
   and !#channels only on ircnet servers.
50.Added event on 1:HOTLINK:wildtext:*/#/?/@/=:/commands, works
   slightly differently from normal events, eg.

   on ^1:HOTLINK:*help*:#:{
     if ($1 == helpme) return
     halt
   }

   on 1:HOTLINK:*:*:echo clicked word $1 in line $hotline

   The first hotlink event is triggered when you move your mouse
   over a word that matches *help*. You can then check $1 to see if
   you want the hotlink hand to appear over the word. If you halt
   the event, no hand will appear. This allows you to filter a word
   based on context.

   The $hotline identifier returns the line which contained the
   hotlink trigger.

   Note: the script for this event should be as small and as fast
   as possible since it triggers each time the mouse is moved over
   a word matching *help*

   The second hotlink event is triggered when you double-click on
   a word which has been filtered through the first hotlink event.

51.mIRC now expands tab characters in text in custom @windows.
52./window -c now works with the Link list window.

55.You can set the tabstops for tab-delimited text in a custom
   @window using /window -t <name> T1 T2 ... Tn

   incorrectly.
68.Fixed $initopic() to handle section names containing [] chars
   which mIRC replaced with ~ chars to prevent INI problems.
69.Added binary operators, $and(a,b), $or(a,b), $xor(a,b), $not(a),
   $biton(a,n), $bitoff(a,n), $isbit(a,n).
70.$window(name) can now reference all windows.
71.Added support for tab control in custom dialogs, example:

   dialog test {
     title "mIRC"
     size -1 -1 110 100
     option dbu

     tab "m", 1, 5 5 100 90
     tab "I", 2
     tab "R", 3
     tab "C", 4

     button  "m is for ... ;)", 11, 30 50 50 24, ok tab 1
     button  "I is for Internet", 12, 30 50 50 24, tab 2
     button  "R is for Relay", 13, 30 50 50 24, tab 3
     button  "C is for Chat", 14, 30 50 50 24, tab 4
   }

   In the above example, I assigned button controls to specific
   tabs, so mIRC handles the showing/hiding of them.

   Can use /did -fu to set the focus on a specific tab, and /did -vh
   to show/hide the control.

   Added $dialog(name) .focus, returns the id of the control (not
   specifically for tabs, general use) that currently has focus,
   and .tab, returns the id of the tab that is currently selected.

   Only one tab control can be defined in a dialog.

                $titlebar $true $version 
86.The ignore list can now be cleared with /ignore -r.
87.Can now /drawrect -e for an empty circle, and /drawrect -ef to
   draw a filled circle.

   displays any channel mode that the server sends, sorts the modes
   alphabetically, except for modes +lk which it adds at the end.
89.Added "check if Service name in use at startup" in Options dialog
   DDE section, prevents mIRC from using a DDE name if another mIRC
   is using it.

91.Halting on NOTICE event now prevents the default sounds for that
   event from playing.

   all of the other $opnick/$nopnick/etc. identifiers.

   Both aohvr parameters are optional. The first specifies which
   nicks you'd like included, and the second specifies the nicks
   you'd like excluded.

   a = all, o = ops, h = helper, v = voiced, r = regular

   Note: the old identifiers are still supported for now.

   opening:

   on 1:open:?:<wildcard text>:commands

   Where the wildcard text will match the message that the user
   is sending to you, causing a new query window to open. This allows
   you to halt the window opening based on the message.

27.On startup, mIRC no longer checks to see if another application is
   using its DDE Service name, this seems to cause problems. This
   means that if another app is using the mIRC DDE Service name when
   you run mIRC, the new mIRC will take over the DDE service name.
28.The date logfile names option now uses the full 4-digit year.

   /filter -io [dialog id] [dialog id] <matchtext>

   Where -i indicates that the input is a dialog and -o indicates
   the ouput is a dialog.
54.Fixed $ignore(address) bug.
55.Added $replacecs() and $removecs() for case-sensitive versions
   of these identifiers.
56.Added on PLAYEND event, triggers when a /play has finished playing
   all queued files.
57.Now allows you to specify up to 9999 for the max number of users

   stored after the users level:address in the user list.

   /auser [-a] <levels> <nick|address> [info]

   write the whole of &binvar to the file.
65.Added new "Lock" section in Options dialog, allows you to lock
   mIRC, disable various features, etc.

   If you hold down the Control key when you minimize mIRC, it will
   ask you for the password when you try to restore the window.

   If you try to Control-minimize with no password set, it asks for
   a temporary password.

66.Added DLL support, allows you to send and receive info from a DLL
   designed to work with mIRC.

     /dll <name.dll> <procname> [data]
     $dll(name.dll, procname, data)

   These open the named DLL, call the procedure in the DLL, and send it
   the specified data.

   The procedure in the DLL being called must be of the form:

     int FAR PASCAL *procname(HWND mWnd, HWND aWnd, char far *data,
     char far *parms, BOOL show, BOOL nopause)

   mWnd is the handle to the main mIRC window.

   aWnd is the handle of the window in which the command is being
   issued, this might not be the currently active window if the
   command is being called by a remote script.

   data is the information that you wish to send to the DLL. On
   return, the DLL can fill this variable with the command it
   wants mIRC to perform if any.

   parms is filled by the DLL on return with parameters that it
   wants mIRC to use when performing the command that it returns
   in the data variable.

   The data and parms variables can each hold 900 chars maximum.

   show is FALSE if the . prefix was specified to make the command
   quiet, or TRUE otherwise.

   nopause is TRUE if mIRC is in a critical routine and the DLL must
   not do anything that pauses processing in mIRC, eg. the DLL should
   not pop up a dialog. Otherwise nopause is FALSE.

   The DLL can return an integer to indicate what it wants mIRC to do:

     0 means that mIRC should /halt processing

     1 means that mIRC should continue processing

     2 means that it has filled the data variable with a command which
       it wants mIRC to perform, and has filled parms with the parameters
       to use, if any, when performing the command.

     3 means that the DLL has filled the data variable with the result
       that $dll() as an identifier should return.

   The 32bit mIRC can only call 32bit DLLs, and the 16bit mIRC can only
   call 16bit DLLs.

67.Added event on RAWMODE, triggers when mode change is made on one or
   more users on a channel, you can use $1- to parse the raw mode change
   yourself.

   on 1:RAWMODE:#mirc:/echo $nick set $chan mode to $1-

   Also added $mode(N).op/deop/ban/unban/voice/devoice/help/dehelp
   which can be used in mode change events to list the nicks affected
   by the mode change.

   eg. $mode(0).op returns the number of opped nicks
       $mode(1).op lists first opped nick

   Added $modefirst and $modelast identifiers, return $true or $false
   depending on whether the event is the first or last to trigger.

68.Custom identifiers now pass parameters separated by commas correctly,
   ie. $test(a, b c, d) will result in $1 = a, $2 = b c, $3 = d

   Also added /tokenize <C> <text> command, this fills $1 $2... $N
   identifiers with tokens separated by character C in text, eg. if
   you used /tokenize 32 $1- in the above $test(a, b c, d) example,
   this would make $1 = a, $2 = b, $3 = c, $4 = d.
69.Fixed bug in $read returning $null for lines containing only one
   character.
70.Fixed /sockread -f bug when used with %vars.
71.Trailing menu separators are now removed from menus.

74.Fixed popup menu separator bug.
75.Extended $right()/$left(), you can now specify a negative value to
   return all but N characters.
76.Added /echo -l switch, applies the "highlight" settings in the
   options dialog to the line that's displayed.
77.Improved message highlight feature in options dialog, now allows
   individual highlight matches each with its own settings.

   For match words you can now specify a word, an identifier or
   variable, or wildcard text.

78.Fixed $snick() returning $null when N = 0 in some cases.
79.Increased custom dialog controls maximum from 250 to 500.
80.Added $did() .visible and .enabled properties, return $true or
   $false.
81.Added /dialog -v switch, makes dialog the active window.
82.Fixed error reporting bug for invalid dialog tables.
83.Added $menu identifier, returns menu name, eg.

   menu nicklist,channel {
     $iif($menu == nicklist,...):{}
     $iif($menu == channel,...):{}
   }

84.Extended $deltok(text,N,C), can now specify N1-N2 a range of
   tokens to delete.
85.Added /query -n switch to open query window minimized.
86.Word completion with Tab Key now works for:

   1) nickname in a query window, 2) nicknames in notify list
   when in status window, and 3) #channel names in your channels
   folder when in any window.

87.Hotlink now won't display hand over an address that contains !
   character.
88.Added $auto $ignore $protect identifiers, return $true or $false
   if /auto /ignore /protect is on or off.
89.Added $abook(nick,N) identifier, with properties, .nick .info
   .email .website .picture .noteN to return address book info.

   Allowed formats $abook(nick) $abook(N) $abook(nick,N) where
   nick can also be a wildcard.

90.Extended /filter command, format is now:

   /filter [-sgdfwxnprcteu] [n-n2] [C S] <infile> <outfile> <matchtext>

   -c = clear output window/file before writing results to it

   -t = sort output based on column C using character S as the
        columns separator, -e = descending, -u = numeric sort.

   Also, if the input and output are the same window/file, mIRC
   will process the request correctly.

91.Toggling MDI/desktop window now keeps editbox contents.
92.Added $disk(C) .type .free .label, you can test if a hard-disk
   exists or is accessible with $disk(C), returns $true/$false.
93.Fixed DCC Send freezing bug.
94.If the switchbar "sort tabs" switch is on, DCC sends/gets are
   sorted in the order in which they were started.
95.Added support for !channels for IRCnet. mIRC only enables this
   on IRC servers with >= 2.10 in server numeric 004.

   Note, important consequence: when mIRC is on IRCnet >= 2.10,
   it internally recognizes ! as a channel prefix. This may
   results in script/etc. problems where ! is used to identify
   a fileserver session.

96.Added support for IRCX %#channels, and for owner .nicks in
   channel nick listbox, as well as /mode +q. mIRC also does
   /listx on IRCX servers by default now and reads numerics
   811, 812, 816, and 817 for the channels list. mIRC recognizes
   IRCX servers by seeing a >= 5.5 in the server numeric 004.

   Note, important consequence: when mIRC is on IRCX >= 5.5,
   it internally recognizes % as a channel prefix.  Since % is
   used as a variable prefix in scripts/aliases/etc. in mIRC,
   this may result in script/etc. problems.

97.Now shows "you're not channel operator" server message in
   channel window.
98.Can now use $(vars/identifiers) in remote event match sections
   to evaluate any combination of vars/identifiers/text, eg.

   on 1:TEXT:$(*hello $me $+ *):?:echo hello back!

99.Added support for local variables by using the /var command:

   var %x = 1, %y, %z = $me

   Local variables can only be used in the alias in which they
   were created and are destroyed when the alias terminates.

100.You can no longer unset a variable by using /set with no
    value, you must use /unset.
101.Fixed /nick gpf bug when specifying very long nicknames.
102.Extended /bset command:

    /bset -t <&binvar> <bytepos> <asciivalue> [<asciivalue> ...]

    The -t switch indicates that it should treat the values as
    plain text and copy them directly into the &binvar.

    Also added N2 range parameter to $bvar(&binvar,N[-N2]), and
    a .text property which returns plain text up to the first
    zero character.

    Also added /breplace command:

    /breplace <&binvar> <oldvalue> <newvalue> [<oldvalue> ...]

103.Fixed $mask() ip address related bug.
104.Added option in General dialog, right-clicking mouse button on
    a line in a listbox can now auto-select it.
105.Added Merge button in logging dialog, merges log files based on
    the file date.
106.$notify(nick) now returns Nth position in the notify list.
107.Can now force a permanent scrollbar in a custom dialog listbox
    by using "vsbar" property.
108.Fixed /sound not being time-stamped, as well as a few other
    commands.
109.Fixed /write -d bug, was deleting empty lines.
110.When specifying the -swl switches in /write and $read, the text
    or number can be specified in the next parameter, doesn't need to
    be appended to the switch. eg. $read -l 5 filename, or
    /write -w *wildcard* filename text

   active window as the parent, and -x closes a dialog without triggering
   any events.
34.Fixed bug with Beeping/Flashing settings not being remember for DCC
   chat windows.
35.Fixed checkboxes with "push" style only triggering sclick event when

39.mIRC now shows the server text for numeric 375 (Start of MOTD) instead
   of using it's own internal text.
40.Fixed drag-drop filenames being made lower-case.
41.Fixed shift-key behavior when minimizing mIRC to tray.
42.Added -3 and -4 values to $dialog(), -3 opens the dialog using the 
   current active mIRC window as the parent, and -4 opens the dialog using
   the current active mIRC dialog as the parent, if no dialog is open, it
   defaults to -3.
43.Fixed bug in $gmt, added $gmt(format) same as in $asctime().
44.Added /write -w<wildtext> switch which finds a line that contains the
   matching wildcard text. Also extended -sw switches so you can now specify
   multiple words enclosed in "" quotes.

61.$calc() now treats $null values as zero.
62.$?, $dialog(), and /dialog now warn you if you try to use them from
   inside an event. You should use /timer to initiate them, and they
   will appear after the event ends.

   Note: /dialog was causing problems when called from an event, there
   was no way to get around this unfortunately due to the current script
   parser design.

63.Added /did -nm, -n to enable and -m to disable an editbox.
64.$replace() and $remove() now accept $null values.
65.Fixed /dialog -n not removing topmost setting.

74.Can now use %variables in dialog table definitions for certain items:
   title, size, "text", id, and icon name and n index.

5.Fixed bug in $findfile(), $finddir(), /copy command, and the files list
  in the Logging tab of the Options dialog, for 32bit under win32s.
6.Added -t switch to $read, prevents mIRC from checking if the first line
  is a number, it treats it as plain text.
7.Fixed $mask() types 11 to 19 not removing ~ prefix from userid.

   specify a nickname.
14.$nopnick() now returns all nicks that aren't ops, $nhnick() returns all
   nicks that aren't helpers/voiced (excluding nicks that are ops), and
   $nvnick() returns all nicks that aren't voiced (excluding nicks that are
   ops or helpers).
15.Added $& identifier, allows you to break up a single line into multiple
   lines which are combined when the script is performed, so you can edit
   long commands more easily.:

   test {
     echo You can now split up long commands $&
     into several lines to make them easier to $&
     edit
   }

16.Your own messages and notices are now time-stamped if you have time-
   stamping turned on in a window.
17.Fix bug in $findfile()/$finddir() identifiers, file handles weren't
   being freed in some situations in the 32bit mIRC.
18.Added Nick List menu item to Channel Window System menu, allows you to
   position nick list to the right or left, or to turn it off.
19.The file dialog used for selecting pictures now displays a preview of
   the selected picture.
20.URL catcher now also catches https:// addresses.
21.Added extra memory checks in $+ and other areas of script processing to
   warn when concatenated strings are too long.
22.You can now double-click directly on URLs in windows to open a web browser.

   You can also hold down the shift-key and double-click on email addresses
   to open your email program. The shift-key is required because of the
   huge number of addresses on IRC which look like emails but aren't.

   If you're in a channel window and you move the mouse over text that is a
   nickname on that channel, you can double-click on it for the usual double-
   click behavior, or right-click on it to open the nickname list popup menu.
   If you single-click on the nickname, the cursor in the listbox is scrolled
   to that nickname.

   You can also double-click on a channel name to join it.

   If you move the mouse over text that is a nickname in your Notify list,
   right-clicking will pop up the notify popup menu.

23./ddeserver and /sound are now quiet when . prefixed.
24.Added "Sort" item to Channels List window popup menu, allows you to sort
   by channel name, number of users, or channel topics.
25.Using a faster sort routine for sorting the IRC servers list.
26.Made small changes to appearance/processing of Chat/Fserve windows.
27.DDE can now be turned off, and will also remember to turn on again if it
   failed to initiate previously.
28.Fixed /writeini bug locking file after showing "file too large" warning.
29.Implemented new indexing method for scripts.
30.Added $mircexe identifier, returns full path/name of mIRC exe file.
31.Fixed /window -c closing gpf bug, related to mouse events processing.
32.mIRC now recreates the download/logs/sounds directories if your INI file
   contains invalid directory names for them.
33.Changed the file/dir existence checking method, it was previously treating
   non-accessible files ie. no read/write/etc. allowed, as non-existent.
34.Control-F dialog in status/channel/etc. windows now allows you to enter
   up to 90 characters as search text.
35.Fixed script.ini renaming bug.
36.Added $network identifier, mIRC gets the name of the IRC network you are
   on from numeric 001, ie. "Welcome to the N Internet Relay Network", where
   N is the name of the network. If it can't find a network name (some IRC
   networks don't have this info), it uses the Group name of the server if
   it's in your IRC Servers list.

   The network name is used to select the correct filename in the List
   Channels dialog, eg. if you connect to a DALnet server, mIRC will now
   auto-select the channels list file called dalnet.txt.
37.Fixed /*line related gpf bug with invalid colour value.
38.Fixed .ial flag, is now reset when you turn IAL on/off.
39.Single/multi-line editbox now beeps if you enter a line that may be too
   long to be processed by the server.
40.Optimized switchbar dragging routine.
41.Fixed bug in /log command.
42.If you have a /query window open with someone, private messages from them
   won't be ignored even if their address matches an ignore address.
43.Now processes numeric 437 which is sent on some IRC networks when you try
   to rejoin a channel after a split and it doesn't allow you.
44.Removed Topic in channel option, now default.
45.Main window background picture is no longer resized when the MDI window
   scrollbars appear/disappear.
46.Added "Save as..." menu item to Custom Picture windows System menu, and
   the /drawsave <@window> <filename> command, which allow you to save the
   picture in a @window to a BMP file.
47.Fixed horizontal scrollbar width in custom windows which use a tabbed
   listbox.
48.Added /window -E switch, creates a custom window with a multi-line editbox.
49.Added Show Ctcps in active window switch.
50.Fixed bug relating to file dialogs, may have been causing mIRC to freeze
   in some situations.
51.Numeric 477 is now handled differently based on the IRC network you are
   connected to since it's used for conflicting purposes on different IRC
   networks.
52.Fixed custom window bug where it would trigger menu {} and mouse events
   even if the popup menu name wasn't specified.
53.Fixed bug in handling of :goto jump points in some situations.
54.When the switchbar is turned on, the Alt-N key combination now refers to
   the Nth window in the switchbar, any windows not shown in the switchbar
   are placed at the end of the Alt-N list.
55.Improved /timers to more precisely measure elapsed time. Also added
   /timer -c switch, makes mIRC "catch up" a timer by executing it more than
   once during one interval if the real-time interval isn't matching your
   requested interval. This happens often because timer messages can be
   delayed by a few milli-seconds each time they are triggered due to the
   OS being busy, and the number of milliseconds lost accumulates over time.
56.Added preview button in file dialogs for playing .wav files.
57.Fixed bug in $ulist().
58.Changed behavior of event "on chat/serve" with and without the ^ prefix
   to allow you to /halt the default behaviors of an fserve.
59.Fixed /log command not working with DCC Chat/Serv windows.
60.Added "lbclick" menu {} listbox event, triggers when a user clicks on an
   item, or selects an item using the cursor keys, in a @window listbox.

   menu {
     lbclick: echo 4 selection: $active $1
   }

61.Added -b switch to /sockwrite, allows you to specify the number of
   bytes to send.

   /sockwrite [-tnb] <name> [numbytes] <text|%var|&binvar>

   Added -n switch to /sockread, allows you to read a CRLF terminated
   line into a &binvar. If the incoming line does not contain a CRLF,
   no bytes will be read into &binvar, unless you specify the -f switch,
   which forces the read (same as when reading into %vars).

   /sockread [-fn] [numbytes] <%var|&binvar>

62.Added on notify/unotify to the haltable ^ events list.
63./write now doesn't append an LF character to the end of your line if
   it already ends in an LF character.
64.Fixed filename checking routine, was treating too many characters as
   invalid and replacing them with an underscore character.
65.Fixed freeze bug in bracketed identifiers containing certain $+
   combinations.
66.Added support for DALnet WATCH list. mIRC now uses this for its notify
   feature when on DALnet servers >= 4.6.3 since it's far more efficient.
   All mIRC does is submit a list of nicknames to the server, and the server
   then notifies mIRC whenever a user comes on or off the network.

   If you specify a full address (or wildcard address) eg. nick!id@host as
   a notify nickname, mIRC will match the address against the reply from
   the WATCH notifications. You can also specify a wildcard address.

   Also added Dalnet specific options in Notify dialog, only appear when
   connected to a DALnet server.

   On non-DALnet servers, mIRC still uses the old notify method which sends
   an ISON with your entire notify list every 40 seconds or so to get an
   update. This method ignores the address portion of your notify nickname
   if you specified one.

67.mIRC now converts ANSI colour codes in private and channel messages to
   mIRC color codes. Also added $ansi2mirc(text).
68.Fixed bug in $read -w switch, wasn't stripping off ending CRLF at end of
   line before doing match.

   Extended $read -w and -s switches so you can now specify multiple words
   enclosed in quotes.
   
   //echo $read -nw"*t public &" versions.txt

69.Added on ACTION and on OPEN to ^ events. on ACTION now behaves exactly
   the same way as on TEXT, including the way it triggers the on OPEN event
   if a Query window isn't already open.

   on ^OPEN is now triggered before a new Query window is created, allowing
   you to /halt it, and on OPEN (as a non ^ event) is triggered right after
   the window is opened. If you /halt on ^OPEN no on ACTION/TEXT events are
   triggered.
70.Fixed bug with switchbar dragging.
71.Extended $findfile() and $finddir() to accept a @window/command. The
   command is performed on every item that matches your request.

   You can also specify a search depth which limits the search to N
   directories deep.

   $findfile(dir, wildcard, N [, depth, @window | command])
   $finddir(dir, wildcard, N [, depth, @window | command])

   Both are optional. The old format is still handled.

72.IRC Server popup menu via the right-click on setup toolbar button now
   lists the top 12 IRC servers, and the top 4 IRC networks.
73.Fixed $nopath()/$nofile() changing filename to lower case.
74.Fixed bug with help file not found dialog popping up at odd times.
75.Currently selected Address Book tab is now remember across sessions,
   when opening and the Notify tab is selected, the Notify listbox gets
   the focus.
76.Moved MDI Options Dialog into New options dialog.
77.Added /writeini -n switch, makes mIRC write to the INI file even if
   it's greater than 64k since some users seem able to create INI files
   of several megabytes.
78.If several users in your notify list have the same associated sound file,
   and the notify list sees them at the same time, mIRC only plays the sound
   once instead of repeating it for each user.
79.If mIRC sees the word "throttled" in the Closing Link disconnect message,
   it waits 10 seconds before trying to connect to the same server again.
80.Added /window +elL switches, +e gives the window a 3D edge under win95,
   and +l makes the window a tool window which has a thin titlebar, +L
   does the same except the window doesn't appear in the taskbar and it
   can't be accessed via the Alt-Tab keys.
81.Added $rnick(#,N) identifier, returns regular (non-op/help/voice) nicks
   on a channel, and isreg if comparison.
82.Long Ctcp messages now wrap correctly in status window.
83.Added /tray -iN <filename> command, changes the mIRC Tray icon to the
   Nth icon in the specified file (which might be an .exe, .dll, or .ico).
84.Disconnect messages are now time-stamped.
85.Can now set/unset the default picture for channel/query/chat/fserve
   windows via the background popup menu. Also added /background -e switch
   to set a picture as the default.
86.Fixed notify sounds not being played in some situations.
87.If you double-click on the mIRC tray Icon and mIRC is the active window,
   it is now minimized.
88.The perform section is now performed before channels are auto-rejoined
   after a disconnect.
89.Added "leave" menu {} listbox event, triggers when the mouse is moved
   outside a picture @window.

   menu {
     leave: echo 4 mouse left $leftwin
   }

90.Added /dns -h switch, makes it treat parameter as a hostname.
91.Fixed timers not seeing local alias -l aliases if a script is /reloaded.
92.Actions now also show if the action was directed at @+% users.
93.Can now specify -1 for /window x,y,w,h parameters to make mIRC use
   default or existing values.
94.Fixed bug in /whois colour not being set properly.
95.Fixed bug with +modeless channel handling, mIRC was assuming that you
   could /msg @+%#channel to send a message to Op/Voice/Help users, but
   only /msg @#channel to send a message to Ops is supported (which is a
   good thing since the /msg +#channel would look the same as a normal
   message on a +modeless channel)
96.Positions of individual query/chat windows can now be saved.
97.Can now use wildcards in /timer -e switch to execute all timers which
   match the wildcard timer name.
98.Can now Control-F in URL dialog.
99.Added /window +d switch, creates a custom window with no border.
100.Can now save the main window position and make the main mIRC window
    stay on top of other windows via the main mIRC system menu.
101.Added $matchkey identifier, returns wildcard matchtext that was
    used in the matching remote event.
102.Fixed bug in display of Editor dialog on being opened.
103.Added /firewall command to allow changing of firewall settings.

    /firewall [-mN[+|-]d] [on|off] <server> <port> <userid> <password>

    -mN where N is 4 or 5 for Socks4 or Socks5 firewall
    +|-d where +d turns on DCCs through firewall, -d turns it off

104.Extended $window() to allow wildcard match, $window(@wildcard,N)
105.Address book now deletes picture associated with a nickname when
    you delete the nickname.
106.Added Date filenames option to Log files dialog, only appears in
    32bit under win95.
107.Added switches to /server to allow modification of servers.ini:

    /server -sar [server] [-p port] [-g group] [-w password] [-d description]

    -s sorts the servers list
    -a adds a server. If it exists, it is udpdated
    -r removes a server

    mIRC tries to find a match for either the server address or the
    description in the existing servers list. You can also specify "none"
    for -g -w and -d to clear the current setting.
108.Fixed /join -n switch not working if you specified several channels
    separated by commas.
109.Fixed $matchtok() making all text lower case.
110.Fixed bug in Find Text dialog in Editor dialog.
111.Added /window -k switch which removes the @ at sign from the name in
    the titlebar.
112.Fixed a gpf buf in /sockwrite relating to queuing of data.
113.Added UDP datagram support to sockets scripting. UDP is a connection-
    less protocol, ie. you can send information via UDP to other UDP
    addresses without needing to be connected to them first.

    UDP does NOT guarantee that any information you send will actually
    reach its destination. This is the way UDP works, it is not a
    reliable protocol. Also, UDP packets may not arrive in the same order
    as that in which they were sent.

    /sockudp [-bntk] <name> [port] [<ipaddress> <port> [numbytes] [data]]

    -bnt are the same as in /sockwrite.

    -k forces the socket to stay open, this allows it to listen for data
    that is sent to its port via UDP. If -k is not specified, the socket
    is opened, the information is sent to the specified ipaddress and
    port, and the socket is then closed.

    If you specify a socket <name> that doesn't exist, it is created. If
    it does exist, the existing socket is used to send the info.

    You can also specify the local port number that you wish to use, if
    it isn't specified, mIRC chooses one randomly.

     Note: If you specify a socket name and a port, and the socket name
     exists but is using a different port, mIRC will report an error since
     it assumes you want a socket with that specific port.

    <ipaddress> and <port> specify the destination address to which you
    want to send information. You can only use an IP address here.

    <data> is the information you want to send.

    The on UDPREAD event and the /sockread command can be used to read
    incoming info on a UDP socket.

    Also added $sock() .type property, returns UDP or TCP, and .saddr and
    .sport properties, return source address and port of last received UDP
    packet.

114.Added $isfile(filename) and $isdir(dirname) identifiers, return $true
    or $false.
115.Added /ajinvite [on | off] to turn auto-join on invite on or off.
116.Added $istok(text,token,C) returns $true or $false if token exists
    in text, and $numtok(text,C) returns number of tokens in text.
117.Added /colour <name> <index> which allows you to change the colour
    settings for items in the Colours dialog.
118.Added /mdi -act to arrange icons, and cascade/tile windows.
119.Added on KEYDOWN/KEYUP events, and $keyval and $keyrpt identifers.

    on 1:KEYDOWN:@window:key,...:echo pressed key $keyval $keyrpt
    on 1:KEYUP:@window:key,...:echo released key $keyval

    Where @window is the custom window name, and key is a numeric key
    value, eg. spacebar = 32. You can specify a list of key values
    separated by commas, eg. for the cursor keys:

    on 1:KEYDOWN:@:37,48,39,40:echo pressed cursor key $keyval

    Note: these events will only work in custom @windows without an
    editbox and a listbox.

120.Can now load /background pictures for custom @windows.
121.Can now manipulate position/size of channel, private, etc. windows
    using the /window command.
122.Added /window -w switch which turns a @windows switchbar button on
    if it was previously turned off.
123.Added format specification to $asctime() $time() and $date().

    Year       yy      98
               yyyy    1998
    Month      m       1
               mm      01
               mmm     Jan
               mmmm    January

                       appended to a number
    Timezone   z       +0
               zz      +0000

    $asctime(ctime,format)
    $time(ctime,format)
    $date(ctime,format)

    If only the format is specified, the current time is used.

124.Fixed freeze bug in $rand().
125.Added popup menus for channels folder, finger, chat, and notify
    toolbar buttons.
126.Fixed bug in * userlevel prefix in script events for matching any
    level user, was matching even if a user level matched another event.
127.mIRC will now only ask you once if you want to create a new sounds
    or logs folder.
128.Added $window().fontbold property, returns $true or $false.
129.Added Hide minimized desktop windows option to Windows dialog,
    removes a window's button from the taskbar when you minimize it,
    unless you're holding down the shift key at the time.
130.Added $gmt and $asctime without brackets.
131.Added -r"root directory" command line switch when running EXE,
    allows you to set the root mIRC directory.
132.Increased time-out for firewall connections from 60 seconds to
    180 seconds.
133.Moved all text to resources area.
134.Added $file(filename).size,.mtime identifier, .mtime returns a
    $ctime value indicating when the file was last modified.

    Note: $lof() is supported for now but will be removed in future.

135./timer command now knows when it is initated from inside a remote
    script event.
136.Fixed bug in tabbed dialogs, some controls weren't appearing in
    some situations.
137./filter no longer allows you to specify the same window for in & out.
138.Added Trim log files option which keeps log files below the max Kbytes
    limit that you specify. The log file is only trimmed when a window is
    opened. If it's greater than the max size allowed, it is  trimmed to
    60% of the max size allowed.
139.Fixed gpf/freeze bugs relating to [] brackets.
140./set -u0 now unsets a variable at the end of a script.
141.Added /copy -a switch to append to a file.
142./sockmark now allows storage up to the max. length of chars that mIRC
    usually handles for other lines.
143.Added -r switch to /filter, specifies the range of lines which you want
    to filter, /filter [-sgdfwxnpr] [n-n2] <infile> <outfile> <matchtext>

    Also add -lL switches, -l filters from the side-listbox in the first
    window, -L filters to the side-listbox in the second window.

144.Added custom dialog creation commands and identifiers.

    The /dialog command allows you to create a modeless dialog:

    /dialog -mdtsonkc name [table] [x y w h] [text]

    -m   = create a modeless dialog using 'table'
    -d   = open dialog on desktop
    -t   = set dialog title
    -s   = set dialog size/pos
    -o   = set dialog ontop of all windows
    -n   = unset ontop setting
    -k   = click ok button
    -c   = click cancel button

    You can create a dialog with the /dialog command by using:

      /dialog -m name table

    Where name is the name by which you will refer to the dialog,
    and table is the dialog table name. Dialogs created with the
    /dialog command are modeless, ie. they do not return a value
    and do not halt a script, and allow access to other mIRC
    windows at the same time. They can be kept open indefinitely.

    The $dialog() identifer allows you to create a modal dialog:

    %result = $dialog(name,table[,parent])

    name    = dialog name
    table   = name of the dialog table
    parent  = window name, or
              -1 desktop window
              -2 main mIRC window

    Dialogs created with $dialog() are modal, ie. they return a
    value, and halt the script and don't allow access to the parent
    window until the dialog is closed. These types of dialogs
    should only be displayed for immediate user input.

    You can also use the $dialog(name/N) identifier to list any
    open dialogs, where N returns the Nth open dialog. If N is zero,
    the total number of open dialogs is returned.

    You can use the dialog prefix to create a dialog table in
    a script using this format:

    dialog name {
      title   "text"
      size    x y w h

      text    "text", id, x y w h, style  (right, center)
      edit    "text", id, x y w h, style  (right, center, multi, pass, read, return, hsbar, vsbar, autohs, autovs)
      button  "text", id, x y w h, style  (default, ok, cancel)
      check   "text", id, x y w h, style  (left, push, 3state)
      radio   "text", id, x y w h, style  (left, push)
      box     "text", id, x y w h, style

      list    id, x y w h, style          (sort, extsel)
      combo   id, x y w h, style          (sort, edit, drop)

      icon    id, x y w h, filename, index
    }

    In addition to the styles shown in brackets for each type of
    control, you can also specify styles:

    disable  - to disable the control
    hide     - to hide the control
    group    - to identify the start of a group
    result   - to identify the control whose value will be used as
               the return value to the calling script when the dialog
               is closed by pressing the ok button.

    If you specify -1 for any of the x y w h values in the size
    setting for the dialog, a default setting is used. To make
    mIRC center the dialog in a window, specify x y as -1 -1. The
    size setting can be over-ridden in the "init" event by using
    /dialog name x y w h.

    Note: You must specify an ok and/or cancel button. When a user
          clicks the ok or cancel buttons, the dialog is closed. You
          can prevent the dialog from closing if a user clicks the
          ok button by using /halt.

    Clicking certain controls in the dialog triggers the on dialog
    script event:

    on dialog:name:event:id: {
      echo $dname $devent $did
    }

    Where name is the dialog name, id is the number of the control
    triggering the event, and event can be:

    init    = when dialog is about to be displayed, controls can be
              initialized in this event. id is zero.
    edit    = text in editbox changed
              text in editbox of combobox changed
    sclick  = single click in list/combo box
              check/uncheck of radio/check buttons
              click of a button
    dclick  = double click in list/combo box

    The /did command allows you to modify dialog controls by id
    number:

    /did -ftebvhcukradiog name id [n] [text | filename]

    -f   = set focus on id
    -t   = set id as default button

    -e   = enable id
    -b   = disable id
    -v   = make id visible
    -h   = hide id
    -c   = check checkbox/radiobutton list/combo line
    -u   = uncheck checkbox/radiobutton list/combo line
    -k   = works with -c and -u, keeps other listbox selections

    -r   = clear all text in id
    -a   = add line of text to end
    -d   = delete Nth line
    -i   = insert text at Nth line
    -o   = overwrite Nth line with text

    -g   = set a new icon/bmp to an icon control
           /dialog -g name id [n] filename

    Note: you can mark a 3state checkbox as indeterminate by using
          both -cu switches.

    You can refer to controls using the $did() dialog id identifier
    with the following formats and properties as appropriate to the
    control to which you are referring:

    $did(name,id)
    $did(name,id,N)

    Note: if used in a triggered event, "name" is optional.

    .text    = returns line or Nth line
               $did(id) is same as $did(id).text
    .len     = returns length of line or Nth line
    .lines   = returns number of lines
    .sel     = returns Line Number of Nth selected line
               if N is 0, returns number of selected lines
    .state   = returns 0 = off, 1 = on, and 2 = indeterminate
    .next    = returns id of next control in tab order
    .prev    = returns id of previous control in tab order

145.Added option in the Windows dialog to make the Editor dialog
    modeless ie. opens it as a desktop window, allowing editing of
    scripts while chatting etc.
146.$cb() should now process LF and/or CR delimited lines properly.
147.Made change to /unload command so that it will match the filename
    you specify with a loaded filename even if you don't provide a full
    path specification.
148.Fixed $*nick(#,nick/N) returning N = 0 for non-existent nicknames,
    now returns $null.
149.If you load/unload alias/popup/script files while the Editor dialog
    is open, the Editor now updates its current view accordingly.

24/07/98 - mIRC v5.41

Changes:
1.Fixed win32s under win3.x display bug in 32bit mIRC.
2.Fixed bug with private messages text-wrap when using ^ events.
3.Can now use %variables or $identifiers in the Perform Highlight words.
4.Can now do /dcc send nickname <wildcardfilename>.
5.Fixed $sdir bug.
6.Fixed bug in auto-arrange/cascade/tile options.
7.Fixed SOCKS firewall support bugs.
8.Channel Central dialog now allows mode +h users on TS4 efnet to change
  the channel settings.
9./remove now tells you if you specified a non-existent file but doesn't
  halt processing.
10.Changed Channel central dialog behavior, no longer resets channel modes
   unless they've been changed.
11.Fixed bug in $calc() with very long strings.
12.Fixed bug in inactive DCC Chat windows, editbox allows you to copy text
   from it but entered text is not processed in any way.
13.$chan().ial now returns $true if the IAL is full, $false if it isn't, or
   $inwho if you sent a /who #channel to the server to fill the IAL and the
   IAL isn't full yet.
14.Improved winsock error checking.
15.Fixed bug in /goto command where it was incorrectly reporting a "not
   found" error instead of a "duplicate name" error in some situations where
   you had duplicate goto names in a script.
16.Fixed bug in the remote events in %variables in remote event definition
   not being processed correctly if it evaluated to just #.
17.Fixed /renwin bug allowing you to rename a @window to any name without
   the @ prefix.
18.Fixed $read bug when reading a line with only a space in it.
19.Fixed disappearing DCC windows bug.
20.Fixed bug with URL/Email catcher being turned off when using the Send
   To menu in the URL window popup menu.
21.Fixed bug with Status window not remembering MDI/desktop position.
22.Fixed editbox/listbox focusing bug.
23.Fixed BURC code stripping in IRC Switches not applying to channel topics.
24.Using the . prefix to hide /play command information now also hides the
   /msg command information when sending to a user/channel.

   triggering if on OPEN was /halted.
29.Can now specify whether you want DCCs to go through the Socks Firewall
   or not.
30.Fixed /renwin bug, was halting scripts.
31.Fixed bug when processing $? in combination with $+ in some situations.
32.$findfile() and $finddir() in 32bit mIRC now maintain case of filenames.
33.Fixed bug with wave playing not working with certain sound drivers. Note
   that simple sound drivers eg. speaker driver, are very limited and don't
   support mIRC's queuing of sounds feature, etc.
34.Fixed /cline when colour not specified, sets to default colour.
35.Fixed ctcp event not processing wildcard ctcps, eg.

   ctcp 1:*ping*:echo $1-

36.Fixed DCC Send CTCP request not working with IRC clients that add an extra
   ID number to the CTCP message, mIRC v5.4 also uses this extra ID to identify
   DCC Send requests through a SOCKS firewall. If mIRC sees an ID but can't
   match it internally, it assumes it's not valid and processes the CTCP as a
   normal DCC Send request.
37.Improved handling of long filenames in commands: /dcc send, /unload, /mkdir,
   /loadbuf, /savebuf, /filter, and /window.
38.Fixed bug in /font command.
39.Extended various commands/identifiers/etc. that reference listboxes so that
   they can now process any number of selected lines.
40.Can now /clear -n with a picture window, where -n delays update of the display
   until you force an update (same as with other picture window commands).
41.Fixed bug in $iif(), remote identifiers in it where not being evaluated.
42.Added $inpoly(x,y,x1,y1,...,xN,yN) identifier which returns $true if x,y is
   inside the polygon made up of the specified points, otherwise $false.
43.Changed DCC server 150 and 151 replies, they now return "unavailable" and
   "rejected" instead of a nickname.
44.Added .dx and .dy properties to $window(), return the x and y position of
   a window relative to the desktop.
45.Changed $notify() so that it works with your whole notify list. Added
   .ison property, returns $true if user is on IRC, otherwise $false.
46.Fixed bug with status window receiving focus in certain situations.
47.Fixed bug in /write command when /writing to files that aren't on the same
   hard-disk as the mIRC exe file.
48.Fixed freezing bug in $dde, $read, and $readini when used within other
   identifiers in some situations.
49.The on DNS event is now triggered if you try to /dns a nickname that's not
   on IRC and the server replies with the "no such nickname" numeric.
50.Fixed bug in listbox windows eg. url/notify/channelslist/etc. when first
   opening, the background was first set to the main window background colour
   not the listbox colour, making the window flash.
51.Fixed bug in ip address having a space appended to it when looking up via
   the server method. Shouldn't have affected processing though.
52.Extended $mask() and all other mask-related commands/identifiers, so that
   you can now specify a type of 10 to 19 which correspond to masks 0 to 9,
   but instead of using a * wildcard to replace portions of an address, it
   uses ? wildcards to replace the numbers in the address.
53.Fixed bug in /window -h switch not setting window focus correctly.
54.Fixed /list command so that it works correctly with older DALnet ircds
   that don't support serverside filtering.
55.The value of $halted can now be checked in any event to see if a previous
   event /halted the default text. You can also prefix events with the new
   & prefix to prevent the event from triggering if $halted is true, eg.

   on &1:text:*:?:/echo this won't trigger if $halted is true

56.When mIRC joins a channel and issues a /mode to look up the channel modes,
   the channel creation time numeric is hidden if sent by the server.
57."Unable to connect to IRC server" message now also shows the actual winsock
   error message.
58./enable and /disable now accept wildcards.
59./loadbuf and /savebuf can now work with DCC =chat windows. Also added
   switches to /loadbuf:

   -cN specifies default text colour
   -e  evaluates lines
   -h  hides a line if -e is specified and it doesn't evaluate

60.Fixed /window -c closing gpf bug when using multiple /window opening
   and closing commands in the same script.
61.Added $isdde(name) identifier, returns $true if DDE name is in use.
62./background can now change background in DCC =chat windows.
63.Fixed bug in remote * event prefix.
64.Timestamp now shows double digits for the hour.
65.Time related identifiers/routines now return $null if a time value is
   specified that lies outside the values mIRC can handle.
66.Fixed /.copy showing a line separator incorrectly.
67.Fixed bug in Editor dialog, if you loaded a new script and then closed
   the dialog, the on load event in the script would only trigger if you
   were in the Remote tab of the dialog.
68.Added -l switch to /ignore [-lpcnitkx] command, specifying the -l switch
   now displays a list of the ignores which match the specified switches.
69.Fixed bug in Socks firewall handling of a DCC Send to an IP address ie.
   to a users DCC server.
70.Fixed /echo -a =chat bug.
71.Fixed switchbar display bug.

73.If the Channels folder dialog is open while connecting to a server,
   the Join/Names buttons are enabled on connection.
74.Fixed gpf bug in /cline when trying to use it on an empty window.
75.Extended $os identifier in the 32bit mIRC, it now replies differently
   depending on whether you're on 3.1, 3.1 win32s, 95, 98, and NT. The
   16bit is still limited to replying 3.1 or 95.
76.Added $ulist(address,level,N) identifier for referencing the Users list,
   (replaces $maddress() which is still supported for now).

   You can specify an address of * to match any address in the user list,
   or a wildcard address. If you don't specify a full address, it completes
   the address with wildcards.

   If you specify L, $ulist() will return matching addresses that contain
   the specified level.

   Note: L and N are optional, but if you specify only one number, mIRC
   assumes it is N, to maintain backward compatibility.
77.Changed $calc() evaluation method slightly, this may break existing
   scripts.
78.Fixed a few /finger and fingerserver related bugs.
79.Fixed /auto -r bug.

  and on load sections when your script loads multiple files.
6.Added identd switch to turn identd on/off before/after connection.
7.Added identifier $isalias(name) returns $true/$false.
8./dns now returns a reply for each /dns that is issued even if you
  specified multiple identical addresses.
9.In addition to specifying -1 in $window() to refer to the desktop
  screen size, you can now also specify -2 for the main mIRC window,
  and -3 for internal MDI window where other windows are displayed.
10.Fixed focusing bug when clicking in a window.
11.Added /reload command, reloads the specified script without
   triggering the on start/load events.
12.Added $finddir(root,wildcard,N) works the same as $findfile()
   except it returns directory names.
13.Added Options section to Address Book.
14.Fixed Help menu bug when more than 30 items where listed in
   the menu.
15.Added support for numeric 477, tells you if you can't join
   a channel if channel only allows registered nicks.
16.Added /renwin <@old> <@new> [topic] command, changes the name
   of a custom window.
17./sockopen now triggers "on sockopen" if a connection fails
   immediately, instead of just halting the script with a connection
   error message.
18.Fixed /editbox command when using lines with CR/LF characters.
19.Can now handle DALnet @+target notices.
20.Small change in DCC Send routine which may have been causing a
   freeze in certain situations.
21.Fixed bug in action messages, may have been preventing action
   messages from being displayed sometimes.
22.Can now open the Channels Folder and Channels List dialogs when
   not connected to a server to edit/view them offline.
23.$chan now works in the on input event.
24.Fixed bug in Alt-1,2,3,etc. that was causing a gpf in certain
   situations.
25.Fixed display gpf bug which occurred when a window was resized
   to a width smaller than an indented line.
26.Made a small change to the way DDE messages are sent, should
   now work with more applications.
27.Fixed bug in Filserver, wasn't displaying the list of dirs or
   files correctly in certain cases.
28.Added switch -S to /window command. The small -s now sorts the
   main window (whether text or listbox), the large -S now sorts
   a listbox on the side.
29.Fixed gpf bug when the custom menubar popup menu is empty and
   a new item is added to it.
30.The TAB nick completion now works in custom windows.
31.Fixed /join -i bug.
32.Your nicknames, local info, and current irc server are now all
   updated in mirc.ini whenever they change.
33./filter no longer creates a file if there were no matching
   items to output to the file. It also fills the $filtered identifier
   with the number of matches found, if any.
34.A users nick and address are now stored in the log file at the
   start of the logging session for a query window.
35.Now supports serverside filtering of channels list on DALnet
   servers. This is done automatically whenever you retrieve a
   channels list, same as with Undernet servers. DALnet servers
   also supports server-side wildcard filtering.
36.Fixed /editbox -n switch.
37.If you try to connect to a server which resolves to multiple
   IP addresses eg. a round robin server, mIRC will now try each IP
   address until it gets a connection.
38.Colour 99 is now treated as a transparent colour, ie. it will match
   a users current background colour. The main purpose of this is to
   allow you to use numbers after a ctrl-k without a problem, eg.
   /echo ctrl+k5,9954  This would display the number 54.
39.Added $readn identifier to return the line number that matched a
   search for $read -s<text>.

   Also added $read -w<wildtext> switch which finds a line that
   contains the matching text.

   If you specify the -s or -w switches, you can also specify the
   -lN switch to specify which line to start searching from in the
   file, eg.:

   //echo $read -l100 -w*mirc* versions.txt

   Note: this will start the search *after* line 100. This allows
   you to use it with $readn easily.

40.Added -e switch to /dde command, makes /dde send the request as
   an XTYP_EXECUTE DDE message. This type of message does not require
   an item, so the format is:

   /dde -e service topic command

41.Fixed /rline bug.
42.Fixed bug relating to use of [ ] to evaluate items inside
   a bracketed identifier eg.

  //echo 1 $gettok( [ $readini -n mirc.ini mirc host ] ,1,58)

43.Fixed gpf bug when trying to resize a window that contains
   lines of text of which some are empty ie. contain no characters
   at all, was happening mainly when filling a custom window with
   lines from a text file eg. using /filter.

44.Added * as a new remote event prefix, matches the level of any
   user. This allows you to create events that will trigger for
   all users regardless of their access levels.

   on *:event:etc.
   ctcp *:event:etc.

45.Using new method to display icons in toolbar and switchbar, this
   should fix the disappearing toolbar problem some people have been
   experiencing.
46.Added .fname property to $group() identifier, to return filename,
   and the .name property to return the name of the group if you're
   looking up the Nth group.
47.Added /ban -r switch, this removes a ban of the specified type for
   nickname, eg. /ban -r nick 2
48.Url catcher now treats more characters as valid parts of a URL.
49.Fixed bug in $pos() identifier.
50.Added $ctime() identifier to compliment $ctime. You can specify
   the date and time in various formats in $ctime() to return the
   number of seconds elapsed since 00:00:00 GMT, January 1, 1970.

   //echo 1 $ctime(January 1 1970 00:00:00)
   //echo 1 $ctime(3rd August 1987 3:46pm)
   //echo 1 $ctime(21/4/72 1:30:37)
   //echo 1 $ctime(Wed 1998-3-27 21:16)

51.Modifed the way the inc/dec -uN switch works, added two new
   switches, -c and -z.

   -uN now only incs/decs the %var once and unsets it N seconds
   later.

   -c incs/decs %var once per second.

   -z decreases %var until it reaches zero and then unsets it.

   The -z switch also works with /set.

52.Fixed bug in /describe appearance in query windows.
53.Can now use $mouse outside of picture window events. Also added
   the following properties:

   .win     returns the windows name
   .mx/my   returns x,y position relative to mIRC main window
   .dx/dy   returns x,y position relative to desktop
54.Added .fname property to $isalias() identifier, which returns the
   filename inwhich the alias exists, and .alias property which returns
   the alias definition itself.
55.Added $ifmatch identifier, returns the first parameter of a matching if
   statement. eg. if (text isin some text) etc. then $ifmatch will return
   "text".
56.Added /showmirc -nrstx command, where:
     -n = minimize
     -r = restore
     -s = show
     -t = tray
     -x = maximize
57.Added -u switch to /window which removes the -ontop setting
   for a desktop window. Can also reset it again with -o.
58.If you specify a delay of 0 seconds in /timer, the command is now
   executed immediately after a script finishes.
59.Added $cb(N) identifier to return CRLF delimited lines from the
   clipboard. The property .len returns the length of the line, or
   if N is zero, it returns the total length of text in the clipboard.
60.Extended $timer() to handle both N and a Timer name as a parameter.
   Also now returns $null correctly if it can't find a match.
61.Extended $nick/opnick/nopnick/vnick/nvnick() to handle both N and
   a nickname. If a nickname is specified it returns the nicknames Nth
   position in the nicklist.
62.Fixed Window/Icon Flashing bug, wasn't triggering in certain situations.
63.Fixed gpf bug in fileserver time-out event.
64.Fixed /window sizing bug when first opening a very small window.
65.Added .ial property to $chan(), returns $true if the IAL contains the
   addresses of all users on the specified channel, otherwise $false.
66.The TAB key nick completion now works as an identifier/variable evaluator
   when placed over items that begin with $ or % or # (evaluates to current
   channel name).
67.Notify now displays on/off messages in more situations.
68.Can now specify N = 0 in $findtok() to return number of matching tokens.
69.Added $matchtok(Tokens,String,N,C) identifier, checks if any of the Tokens
   contain the text String. eg.

   $matchtok(one two three, e, 0, 32) returns 2
   $matchtok(one two three, e, 2, 32) returns three

   And $wildtok(Tokens,WildString,N,C) which does the same thing using
   wildcards:

   $wildtok(one two three, t*e, 0, 32) returns 1
   $wildtok(one two three, t*e, 1, 32) returns three

70.Added Remove menu item to notify list popup menu.
71.Made a change to /log command to make it handle the file .ext extension
   better with LFNs.
72.Moved notify section from Options dialog to Address Book. Also added
   Notify? and Address? buttons to connect Address and Notify sections.
73.You can now retrieve your basic System colours with $rgb() by specifying:
   face, shadow, hilight, frame, and text, which return the RGB value.
74.Pressing TAB key in an editbox no longer clears the editbox if it
   contains text. The editbox needs to be empty in order for TAB to fill
   in the "/msg nickname" text.
75.DCC Chat window editbox is no longer disabled on a disconnection.
76.Can now click on a number in the Colour index dialog to insert the number
   into the editbox.
77.Fixed $dde gpf if data being received is too long, now returns $error in
   this case.
78.Extended $replace() to handle multiple replace parameters, eg.

   $replace(String,n1,n2,m1,m2,...,t1,t2)

   And $remove() to handle multiple remove parameters, eg.

   $remove(String,n1,n2,n3,...)

79.Replaced channel window switching keyboard command from Control-Space
   to Control-N due to conflict with other applications.
80.Fixed minimized icons appearing in certain sitautions when switching
   windows via switchbar.
81.Speeded up text display slightly.
82.Added $hash(S,B) where S is a string, and B is the number of bits to
   use when calculating the hash number.
83.Can now specify a non-existent file in $file/dir/hfile/sdir dialogs.
84.Added /whois in active window switch. Displays whois results in the
   channel, query/chat, and custom windows if it is turned on and a /whois
   is issued inside one of these windows.

   Also added Whois text colour selection to Colours dialog.

85.Added -g switch to /clear and /filter to refer to finger window.
86.Added Background Picture option to System menu for Status, Channel, and
   Query/Chat windows. Allows you to select a background picture for the
   window, note that this significantly decreases the display speed of
   text in a window.

   Also added picture option to the mIRC background window, right-click
   on it to pop up a menu with options.

   Can also select a background picture for the toolbar, toolbar buttons,
   and switchbar, right-click to pop up a menu.

   You can use the following command to change the background picture
   settings and display method for windows:

   /background [-amsgdluhcfnrtpx] [window] [filename]

   -a = active window (window name not required)
   -m = main mIRC window
   -s = status window
   -g = finger window
   -d = dedicated query window

   -cfnrtp = center, fill, normal, stretch, tile, photo

   -l = toolbar
   -u = toolbar buttons
   -h = switchbar

   Toolbar buttons can use RGB Colour 192,192,192 for transparency, the
   BMP must be of the same form as that in mIRC resources.

   -x = no background picture

   Window name should only be specified if none of the window switches
   are specified. The filename does not need to be specified if you are
   only changing the display method.

87.Added $iif(C,T,F) where C is a conditional clause, and T is the result
   if the conditional is True, and F is the result if it's false, eg:

   echo $iif(1 == 2, yes, no)  returns "no"

   $iif returns F if the conditional returns zero, $false, or $null, for
   any other value $iif returns T.

   If you don't specify the F parameter, $iif returns a T value if the
   condition is true, and returns nothing if it's false.

   echo $iif(1 == 2, yes)  returns nothing

88.mIRC can now display longer channel topics in channels.
89.Added -p switch to /editbox, appends a space to the end of the text.
90.Added -t switch to /echo, prefixes line with a timestamp if a user has
   global time stamping on or timestamping is on for that window.
91.Integrated the notify settings into the Address book dialog.
92.You can now open a query window with the /query command while offline.
93.Fixed $duration() to handle floating point numbers.
94.Titlebars in windows now aren't updated if the new text is identical.
95.Made line sorting in text @windows case-insensitive.

     uclick:echo Released mouse button
   }

99.The switchbar button for a query window is now updated when there is
   a nick change.
100.Added -h switch to /clear command, clears the command history for
    a window.
101.Switchbar can now also be displayed on the left and right sides of the
    mIRC window, you can drag it with the mouse to reposition it.
102.Fixed $server().port including password at end of ports.
103.Fixed problems with sounds not being heard when your system is set up
    to use the internal speaker driver for sound playback, note however
    that this means that events such as on waveend/midiend do not work
    now since the speaker driver doesn't support them.
104.Added /saveini command, updates all mIRC related INI files with the
    current info.
105.Added /ignore -x (exclude) switch. Basically this allows you to ignore
    messages from all people except your friends. For example:

    a!b@c.org,exclude   this excludes this address from being ignored
    *!*@*               this ignores all other addresses

106.Fixed bug in on chat/fserve events not filling $1 correctly.
107.Fixed bug with certain /if operators treating a $null value as plain
    text eg. if (n isin $null) would evaluate to true.
108.Fixed bug with $calc() not processing identifiers with properties.
109.Fixed on close event not triggering for fileserver.
110.Added Command option to DCC Get Directories dialog, allows a command
    to be performed when a file is received. The command will be performed
    if no application has been selected and the filename can be referred
    to in the command as identifier $1-.
111.Fixed /write not adding an extra LF to the last line in a file if it
    needs one before appending a new line to the end of the file.
112.Added Rejoin channels on connect switch to Options dialog, if turned on
    channel windows which are open are auto-rejoined when you reconnect to an
    IRC server.
113.Fixed custom sockets bug where last packet of a file being received was
    not received fully in some cases.
114.Added .font and .fontsize properties to $window().
115.Variables set to the value $null now evaluate to an empty string.
116.Control codes are now stripped from URLs/Emails caught by URL catcher.
117.Fixed bug in DNS resolving routine which may have caused certain
    problems in the situation where a DNS request failed immediately.
    Also fixed a bug where an invalid DNS reply may have caused a gpf.
118./dns -c now clears all queued DNS requests except the one currently
    in progress.
119.Added isincs for a case-sensitive version of isin comparison.
120.Added $fline(@,wildtext,N,T) searches a window for a line matching
    the wildcard text and returns the matching line number. If T is not
    zero, it acts on the side-listbox.
121.The on MODE event now triggers when you make a mode change. You can
    prevent it from triggering on your own mode change using the ! event
    prefix as usual.
122.Fixed /echo bug, can now specify switches with a DCC chat =nickname.
123.You can now prevent the default text for an event from being shown
    by using the ^ prefix in an event definition. This allows you to
    show your own custom event messages, eg.

    on ^1:JOIN:#:echo $chan Joins: $nick | halt

    This line is triggered by a JOIN event and shows your own custom join
    event message, /halt prevents the normal message from being shown.

    The ^ events don't replace your existing events, your normal events
    are independent and are still processed whether there is a ^ event in
    a script or not.

    Events that currently support ^ prefix: BAN, CHAT, DEHELP, DEOP, DEVOICE,
    HELP, INVITE, JOIN, KICK, MODE, NICK, NOTICE, OP, PART, TEXT, UNBAN,
    USERMODE, VOICE, QUIT, SERV, SERVERMODE, SNOTICE, TOPIC, WALLOPS.

    You can also halt the default text without halting a script by using
    the /haltdef command.

    The $halted identifier returns $true if /halt or /haltdef was used in
    a ^ prefixed event, and $false if it wasn't.

124.Added $shortfn(filename), returns short version of a long filename,
    only works in 32bit mIRC. In 16bit, returns same filename.
125.Can now /resetidle <seconds>.
126.Fixed bug in display of DCC transfer window.
127.Fixed bug in timezone calculation routine.
128.Fixed bug in /ignore.
129.Fixed gpf bug in on load/start events.
130.The /ignore and /auto commands now reformat the given nickname/address
    to a full address spec. if it isn't one already.
131.Fixed bug when switching dedicated query window to/from MDI/desktop mode.
132.Removed minimum window size restrictions.
133.Local info is now looked up using the Server method by default.
134.Fixed bug where first item in a listbox was selected when the listbox
    window was first opened.
135.Fixed $target for DCC chat/fserve windows.
136.Added Socks5 firewall support for connecting to an IRC server. mIRC
    passes the domain name to the Socks5 firewall instead of trying to 
    resolve it to an IP itself. mIRC still supports Socks4 however this
    doesn't support authentication or domain name resolution or listening
    for a connection.

    mIRC also supports an EXPERIMENTAL method for DCC Send/Chat through a
    SOCKS5 firewall. This will NOT work with older versions of mIRC or
    other IRC clients.

    mIRC uses a PASSIVE protocol to establish DCC connections when a client
    is behind a SOCKS5 firewall. The method will work with SOCKS5 firewalls
    that both:

      a) Support listening/binding to a port of Zero for an incoming
         connection.
      b) Assign outgoing connections an IP address that's the same as
         the SOCKS firewall IP address.


    The DCC Send/Chat CTCP messages are extended by adding an extra number
    to the end of the message which uniquely identifies the negotiation,
    and a port of Zero is specified to indicate that this is a passive
    connection request. All other fields are identical to a standard DCC
    Send/Chat message.


    DCC Chat Passive Protocol:

    Client A, initiating the DCC Chat, sends the passive connection request
    below to Client B. The port is set to zero, and the id number is a unique
    integer identifying the connection:

    DCC CHAT nickname address port id

    If Client A is behind a firewall, the address is the ip address of its
    SOCKS firewall.

    Client B receives the message and sets up a listening socket, and sends
    the IP address and port back to Client A, specifying the id number that
    identifies Client A's request:

    DCC CHAT nickname address port id

    If Client B is behind a SOCKS5 firewall, it requests a listening socket
    from the SOCKS5 firewall and specifies Client A's IP address as the
    binding address.

    Client A then proceeds to connect to this address to chat. If Client A
    is behind a SOCKS firewall, it sends a connection request to it.


    DCC Send Passive Protocol:

    Client A, initiating the DCC Send, sends the passive connection request
    below to Client B. The port is set to zero, and the id number is a unique
    integer identifying the connection:

    DCC SEND filename address port filesize id

    If Client A is behind a firewall, the address is the ip address of its
    SOCKS firewall.

    Client B receives the message and sets up a listening socket, and sends
    the IP address and port back to Client A, specifying the id number that
    identifies Client A's request:

    DCC SEND filename address port filesize id

    If Client B is behind a SOCKS5 firewall, it requests a listening socket
    from the SOCKS5 firewall and specifies Client A's IP address as the
    binding address.

    Client A then proceeds to connect to this address to begin the transfer.
    If Client A is behind a SOCKS firewall, it sends a connection request
    to it.

    Nb. The DCC Resume and Accept protocols in mIRC are also extended by
    adding the id number to the end of the CTCP message, but otherwise work
    in exactly the same way.

137.Fixed on input bug with chat/fserve windows. Can specify = for matching
    chat events and ! prefix for fserve events, same as on open/close.
138.Fixed bugs in $calc() identifier.
139.Changed the way tooltips are displayed, there is now a small delay
    before a tooltip appears.
140.Fixed bug in /if handling of multiple parameters, eg.:

    if (a b c == a b c) echo yes | else echo no

    This will only work if your /if is specified using () brackets around
    parameters, or {} around the commands following the /if, so that the
    conditional clause is fully specified.

141.Added support for certain Efnet TS4 features.

    mIRC will now process TS4s new mode +h for helper users on a channel,
    for nicknames prefixed with a %.

    Also added new script events and identifiers:

    on 1:HELP/DEHELP:#:echo I just helped/dehelped $hnick

    $hnick() and $nhnick(), same as $opnick()/etc.

    Also added a new /if comparison "ishelp".

    Extended $comchan() properties to: .op, .voice, .help

142.Can now select the background more easily in the Colours dialog.
143.Can now specify a named address when initiating a DCC Send/Chat/Fserve
    in the /dcc command or in the DCC Send/Chat dialogs.
144.Changed kick/part events routines so that the nickname that is parting
    or being kicked is only removed from the channels nickname list and the
    IAL *after* scripts are processed, allowing you to access these users
    settings.

    You can use the /updatenl command to force the nicknames list and IAL
    to update immediately during an on kick/part/quit script event.
145.Can now force a /sockread to read incoming characters into a %variable
    even if the incoming line does not contain a CRLF.

    /sockread -f %var

146.Extended $? input identifier, the dialog will expand vertically to
    accomodate longer questions, and if you use $?* then text will appear
    as ***** to prevent anyone seeing what you're typing.

    If you use $?! then a Yes/No dialog will appear without an editbox,
    it will return $true or $false depending on whether the user clicks on
    Yes or No respectively.

    You can make text appear on different lines by using $crlf identifier
    to separate lines, eg.

    //echo $?="For example: $crlf $+ This is on the 2nd line."

147.I changed the version checking method slightly to recognize NT 5.0.
148.Fixed bug with $().property processing getting confused by %variables
    with . in their name.
149.Added $crlf identifer, returns CRLF characters.
150.Added $sreq and $creq identifiers, return current /sreq and /creq settings
    for DCC Get/Chat respectively (return ask, auto, or ignore).
151.Fixed /drawtext command and $width() identifier so they now work with the
    same measurements correctly.

    If no clipping area is specified in /drawtext, the command should only
    affect the area around the text, whereas before it was affecting most
    of the window.

152.Added $height(text,font,size) returns height of text in pixels for the
    specified font and fontsize.
153.Aded /timer -e switch which executes the specified timer name immediately
    if it exists.
154.Fixed /copy changing filenames to lower case. This only works in the
    32bit mIRC, the 16bit is still limited. The original case of the filenames
    is now retained.
155.When saving the buffer of a query window, the users nickname and address
    are placed at the top of the buffer, if they are available.
156.Fixed bug in Editor dialog where aliases were getting overwritten by the
    variables section in certain situations.
157.You can now save a channel window position as maximized/minimized.
158.Added $os identifier, returns operating system version 95 or 3.x.
159.Fixed /sline bug changing the colour of a listbox item when all you wanted
    to do was select/deselect the line without changing it's colour.
160./splay no longer halts a script if the sound can't be found or played.
161.Fixed =$nick evaluating to just $nick when used outside of a remote
    event. It worked correctly in remote events though.
162.Fixed -sg switches in loadbuf/savebuf commands.
163.Fixed bug where server password was not being set correctly when retrying
    a connection if it failed/you were disconnected before.
164.Fixed bug with $script/$scriptdir not evaluating properly in some cases.
165.Fixed Channel central channel key handling, correctly unsets/sets a channel
    key now if you are changing an existing channel key.
166.Added a fix for undernet ircd behavior regarding channel keys. Here is how
    the new undernet ircd works now:

    If you join a channel with a key, the server will NOT send you the channel
    key to display in the channel window titlebar.

    If an Op changes the channel key while you are on the channel, the server
    will send you the channel key and mIRC will display it in the titlebar
    even if you *aren't* an Op.

    You can only retrieve the channel key after you have become an Op on the
    channel.

    If someone Ops you on a keyed channel and you don't have the channel key
    yet, mIRC sends a /mode #channel to retrieve it so it can display it in
    the channel window titlebar automatically.

    The undernet ircd now sends a +k without specifing the key in the above
    situation, so be aware that you can now have +k but no key. You should no
    longer assume that doing a /mode #channel will get you the full info on
    undernet servers. mIRC will show a +k without a key in the titlebar. 

    mIRC can no longer rejoin a keyed channel automatically in the above
    situation if a) you have "rejoin on kick" turned on, or b) you have
    "rejoin on disconnect" turned on.

167.Fixed bug in Installation program which was causing it to fail in
    certain situations.
168.Fixed bug in INI file saving routine which was preventing INI files from
    being updated properly in certain situations ie. in a network environment,
    where the mIRC EXE is not in the same HD/Directory as the INI files.
169.Fixed line highlighting bug, lines were sometimes being highlighted in
    the wrong situation.
170.Fixed bug in on OPEN/CLOSE events.

   separated into their own popup menus for more room, and mIRC won't
   limit the number of items that are displayed.
16.Added $width(text,font,size,B,C) identifier, returns width of text
   in pixels for the specified font and fontsize. If B is not zero then
   text is in bold, if C is not zero then it interprets colour codes.
17.Fixed /sound display bug, was showing channel info when a channel
   name wasn't specified.
18.Fixed /filter bug.

   mIRC now sets one up so downloaded .wav and .mid files go straight
   into the sounds directory so they can be used immediately with
   /sound and /splay.
28.Fixed on close event bug, closing a @window was triggering an on
   close:?: query event.
29.$count() now returns 0 if the second string is longer.

   the main mIRC window is resized.
27.Fixed notify popup menu problem when notify window first pops
   up on connect.
28.Added /filter command, allows filtering of information.

   /filter [-sdfwxnp] <infile> <outfile> <matchtext>

   The infile can be a filename or a window name (custom or normal).
   The outfile can be a filename or a custom window name. You should
   specify the -fw switches if the names are ambiguous eg.

   /filter -ff in.txt out.txt *mirc*

   This indicates that both are filenames, and:

   /filter -wf #in.txt #out.txt *help*

   indicates that the first is actually a window name, and the
   second is a filename.

   The -x switch excludes matching lines.
   The -n switch prefixes lines with a line number.
   The -s switch makes the status window the infile.
   The -d switch makes the dedicated message window the infile.
   The -p switch wraps the text output in a custom window

29.Added on WAVEEND event, works the same as on MIDIEND. Also added
   $inwave which returns $true/$false if currently playing a wave.
30.Added -qwm switches to /splay command. The -q switch allows you

   with the specific text in the titlebar, but only if mIRC is not the
   active window. The -b switch makes mIRC beep every second, the -w
   switch makes mIRC play the Flash sound specified in the Event Beeps
   dialog.

   Also added Flash option in windows system menu for channel and
   private windows.
60.The mIRC icon/window is now flashed if mIRC is not the active
   window and it receives a private or channel message that triggers
   the highlight option in the perform section.
61.If text specified with the /editbox command contains a linefeed
   character, it is entered into the editbox and immediately processed
   as if you had entered it and pressed the enter key.
62.Changed ctcp event format to:

   ctcp level:matchtext:*|#|?:commands

   This allows you to differentiate more easily between channel and
   private ctcps. The old format is still handled.
63.Fixed /server remembering previous server connection info.
64.While connecting or retrying a connection, the connect/disconnect
   toolbar button remains in the disconnect state.

   appears in string.

70.Now using one routine for reporting the most common errors, and
   the majority of commands now report a filename and line number
   for an error.
71.Added properties to $notify() .note, .sound, .whois, and can now
   specify either a number or a nickname parameter.

81.Can now use === comparison in if statement for case sensitive
   comparisons.
82.Added -f switch to /log command, allows you to specify a filename.

   /log <on|off> <window> [-f filename]

83.Added -l switch to alias prefix in scripts, makes an alias in a
   remote script local to the script, so it can only be called by
   events from within that script. It is invisible to all other
   aliases, scripts, and the command line.

   alias [-l] aliasname { commands }

84.Fixed dclick bug with text/listbox windows.
85.Fixed bug with menubar definitions in scripts not appearing in
   menubar if there isn't a Popup for the menubar defined in the
   Popups dialog.

89.Can now specify the range of port numbers used by DCC in the
   DCC Options dialog.
90.Extended "!nick filename" feature so that it supports .mp3 files.
   (note: mIRC can't play .mp3 files itself).
91.Added $colour(name) identifier, returns colour index N of the
   specified custom colour. You can use the name of the custom colour
   eg. $colour(action text). If you don't specify the full name the
   first partial match is returned eg. $colour(action)
92.Modified line-handling commands/identifiers to treat wrapped lines
   as a single line.
93.Changed /dns queuing method so that it only attempts to resolve
   an address once a previous one has finished resolving, and fixed
   a bug when trying to use /dns from within an on dns event.
94.Added -inx switches to /join, -i joins the last channel to which
   you were invited. The -n switch minimizes, and -x maximizes, the
   channel window when you join it.
95.[removed]
96.Fixed popups display bug when using certain combinations of
   submenu definitions.
97.Extended dclick prefix in script menus so that it can handle
   multiple lines etc.
98.Added -uN switch to /inc and /dec, this increases/decreases the
   specified variable by 1 (and only one) every second, for N seconds,
   and then unsets the variable.
100./write, /writeini, /remini, $read, and $readini now handle long
    filenames enclosed in quotes.
101.Added binary variable/file commands.

    /bread <filename> <bytepos> <numbytes> <&binvar>
    /bwrite <filename> <bytepos> [numbytes] <text|%var|&binvar>

    $bvar(&binvar,N)

    If N is 0, returns the length of the binary variable, otherwise
    returns the ascii number of the Nth character.

    /bset <&binvar> <bytepos> <asciivalue>

    If you try to /bset a variable that doesnt exist, it is created
    and zero filled up to <bytepos>. If &binvar exists and you specify
    <bytepos> beyond it's current size, it is extended to <bytepos>
    bytes.

    Note:
    1.If a bytepos of -1 is used with /bwrite, the info is appended
      to the end of the file.
    2.&binary variables can ONLY be accessed by certain commands
      (only bread and bwrite for now) so they can't be printed or
      assigned or edited.
    3.&binary variables are temporary - they are destroyed when a
      script finishes processing.
    4.Max numbytes is 4096.

102.Added -eiN switches to /echo command. The e switch encloses the
    printed text in line separators. The -iN switch indents the
    wrapped line by N characters.
104.$strip() now also removes leading spaces.
105.Fixed /if bug.
106.Added -m switch to /timer command, uses a millisecond timer.
    Note: millisecond timers can slow mIRC down significantly because
    each timer can trigger many times per second and is processed
    individually, whereas non-millisecond timers are only processed
    once per second in one batch.
107.Added support for raw socket connections.

    $sock(name,N).name,.port,.ip,.status,.sent,.rcvd,.sq,.rq,.ls,.lr,.mark

      .name is the name you give to a connection to identify it.
      .sent and .rcvd return the number of bytes sent and rcvd
       over that connection so far.
      .sq and .rq return the number of bytes queued in the send
       and receive buffers respectively (see below for more info).
      .ls and .lr return the number of seconds since the connection
       last sent and last received info.
      .mark is a user storage area max. 512 bytes (see /sockmark)

       Note: you can use a wildcard name to quickly reference only
       matching entries. The N parameter is optional, if it isn't
       specified it is assumed to be 1.

    $sockname

      $sockname is the name given to a connection to identify
      it. This identifier can be used in events to know which
      connection an event is related to.

    $sockerr

      $sockerr is set to a value after each socket command/event
      and *must* be checked after each socket command and before
      processing an event to see if an error occurred.

    $sockbr

      $sockbr is set to the number of bytes read by a /sockread
      command. It is used to test whether any information was
      in fact read from the buffer (see below for more info).

    $portfree(N)

      returns $true if the specified port number is not in use,
      otherwise returns $false.

    /socklisten <name> [port]

      The /socklisten command listens on the specified port for
      connections to that port. If a port isn't specified, the
      port is selected randomly from the range specified in the
      DCC Options DCC ports section.

    on 1:socklisten:name:commands

      The socklisten event is triggered when someone tries to
      connect to a port that you are listening on. If you want to
      accept the connection you *must* do it in this event using
      the /sockaccept command, otherwise the connection is closed.

    /sockaccept <name>

      The /sockaccept command accepts the current connection to your
      listening port and assigns it a name to identify it.

    /sockrename <name> <newname>

      The /sockrename command assigns a new name to an existing
      connection.

    /sockopen   <name> <address> <port>

      The /sockopen commands initiates a connection to the specified
      address and port. You can specify either an ip address or a 
      named address (which will be resolved to an ip address).

    on 1:sockopen:name:commands

      The sockopen event is triggered when a /sockopen command is
      successful and a connection has been made.

    /sockclose  <name>

      The /sockclose command closes the connection with the specified
      name. If you specify a wildcard name, all connections that match
      the wildcard are closed.

    on 1:sockclose:name:commands

      The sockclose event is triggered when a connection is closed
      by the remote connection (not you).

    /sockwrite [-tn] <name> <text|%var|&binvar>

      The /sockwrite command queues info to be sent on the specified
      connection. mIRC will then try to send that info as quickly as
      it can. Once it has finished sending the info, it triggers the
      on sockwrite event so you can send more info if you need to.

      If you specify the -t switch, it forces mIRC to send anything
      beginning with a & as normal text instead of interpreting it
      as a binary variable. The -n switch appends a CRLF to the line
      being sent if it's not a &binvar and if it doesn't already have
      a CRLF.

      Note: you can use a wildcard name to send the same information
      at once to all connections that match the wildcard.

    on 1:sockwrite:name:commands

      The sockwrite event is triggered when mIRC has finished sending
      all of the info which you previously queued for sending.

      Note: if you try to /sockwrite while there is still info
      queued in the send buffer, your new info will just be added
      to the end of the queue. You can find out how much info is
      currently queued by using $sock().sq (send queue).

    on 1:sockread:name:commands

      The sockread event is triggered when there is info waiting to
      be read on the specified connection. You can read this info
      using the /sockread command.

      Note: If this event triggers but no /sockread is performed
      to attempt to read the buffer, it is assumed that no script
      exists that is handling this buffer, so it is cleared and the
      info it contained is lost.

    /sockread [numbytes] <%var|&binvar>

      The /sockread command reads bytes from the receive buffer into
      the specified variable.

      If you specify a %var variable, a line of text ending with a
      Carriage Return/LineFeed is read into %var. The CRLF are
      stripped off (this may result in %var being $null if the line
      only consisted of CRLF).

      If you specify a &binvar then [numbytes] of info is read into
      the binary variable. If no [numbytes] is specified it defaults
      to 4096 bytes.

      Note: a single /sockread may not be enough to read the entire
      buffer. You should keep reading until $sockbr (bytes read) is
      set to zero. This is far faster than letting mIRC re-trigger
      the event. If your script doesn't read the whole buffer, the
      on sockread event is re-triggered if:
        a) you were reading into a &binvar.
        b) you were reading into a %var and there is still a CRLF
           terminated line in the buffer waiting to be read.

    /sockmark <name> [text]

      The /sockmark command fills the .mark attribute of a socket with
      the specified info for later reference via the $sock().mark
      property. If you do not specify any text, the mark is cleared.

      Note: you can use a wildcard name to set the same information
      at once for all connections that match the wildcard.

108.Changed handling of filenames that don't have a fully specified
    path. If a filename has a directory specified with no drive, it is
    assumed to be in a subdir of the mIRC directory. If it has no drive
    or directory, it is assumed to be in the mIRC directory.
109.Fixed /cd into a filename in fileserver.
110.Implemented new indexing method for IAL.
111.Added $ial identifier, returns $true/$false if ial is on/off.
112.Added two new tokens:

      $deltok(text,N,C)        deletes Nth token
      $puttok(text,token,N,C)  overwrites Nth token

    Extended $find/rem/reptok() so you can specify the Nth matching
    token. The old formats are still handled.

      $findtok(text,token,N,C)     finds Nth matching token
      $remtok(text,token,N,C)      deletes Nth matching token
      $reptok(text,token,new,N,C)  overwrites Nth matching token

113.Fixed MDI/desktop options bug.
114.The # character is now equivalent to $chan in remote events.
115./ulist now displays results in current window.
116.Specifying zero for the N parameter in $mid(text,S,N) now returns
    the number of characters from S to the end of the line.
117.Extended the /window command with the following switches:

    /window [-abcdefhl[N]norsx] [-tN,..,N] [+bfmnstx] etc...

    -f   indicates that [w h] width and height is the required size
         of the text/graphic display area instead of the window size.

    -h   hides the custom window (only appears in Windows list).

    -lN  specifying a number after the l listbox switch now creates
         a custom window with a listbox N characters wide on the
         side (like a channel window).

         Note: The -l switch can be used in custom window related
         commands eg. aline, to reference this listbox.

         You can use $line(@name,N,T) where T is 0 if you are referring
         to the text display or 1 if you are referring to the listbox.
         The old format $line(@name,N) is still supported.

    [-tN,..,N] specify tabstops (in characters) for a listbox window. If
    you add text which contains tabs to the listbox, the text is aligned
    according to these tabstops.

    [+bfnstx] modifify the window appearance.

         b = border
         f = dialog frame
         n = minimize box
         s = sizable
         t = titlebar
         x = maximize box

118.Added /resetidle command to reset $idle timer to 0.
119.on INPUT event can now use wildcard text for window name.
120.Added Close Window Alt+Z menu item to Window menu.
121.Added new on OPEN/CLOSE event which triggers when a window is opened
    or closed. The behavior of this event is slightly different depending
    on the type of window.

    on 1:OPEN:?|@|=|!|*:echo opened $target
    on 1:CLOSE:?|@|=|!|*:echo closed $target

    Channels:    are not handled by these events, they are handled by
                 the on JOIN/PART events.

    Queries:     on OPEN triggers if an incoming message is about to
                 open a new query window.
                 on CLOSE triggers if you close a query window.

    Chat/Fserve: on OPEN triggers when a connection is made.
                 on CLOSE triggers when a connection is closed.

    Custom:      on OPEN never triggers since you manually open a
                 /window anyway.
                 on CLOSE triggers if you close a custom window.

    Note: on CHATOPEN/CHATCLOSE/QUERYOPEN/QUERYCLOSE/SERVOPEN/SERVCLOSE
          events are now obsolete, if you load a script that uses them
          mIRC will (try to) translate them into the new format.
122.Added -h switch to /echo command which forces text to hard wrap.
123.Specifying line 0 with $read eg. $read -l0, now returns the value of
    the first line if it is a number.
124.Fixed remote identifiers not evaluating inside custom identifiers.
125.Added faster indexing for menu {} definitions in scripts.
126.The Text editor now warns you if it was unable to display the
    whole of a file in the editbox.
127.Added -p switch to the /window command, opens a new type of custom
    window for displaying pictures/graphics/text/etc. See below for the
    commands/identifiers available for use with this window.

    /drawdot -ihnr @ <colour> <size> <x y> [<x y>...]

      Draws a dot in the specified colour and size at the specified
      x,y co-ordinates (multiple co-ordinates can be provided).

      The -i switch draws in inverse mode.

      The -h switch highlights the windows icon if it's minimized.

      The -n switch prevents the display from being updated immediately.
      You can specify any of the /draw commands with only a window name
      to update the display (allows you to make changes in the background
      and then display the result when you're finished).

      The -r switch indicates that the colour is in RGB format. You can
      use $rgb(N,N,N) to create an RGB value.

      You can clear the whole window with /clear @windowname.

    /drawline -inr @ <colour> <size> <x y> <x y> [<x y>...]

      This draws a line from the first <x y> co-ordinate to the second,
      if more co-ordinates are specified, the line is continued.

    /drawrect -ihnrfec @ <colour> <size> <x y w h> [<x y w h>...]

      This draws a rectangle of at the specified co-ordinates of the
      specified width and height. If more co-ordinates are specified
      these are also drawn as separate rectangles.

      The -f switch fills the rectangle with the current colour.

      The -e switch draws an Ellipse instead of a rectangle.

      The -c switch draws a focus rectangle.

    /drawfill -ihnrs @ <colour> <colour> <x y> [filename] [<x y>...]

      This fills an area with the specified colour starting at the
      specified co-ordinates.

      If the -s switch is specified, this means that the second colour
      parameter is the colour that should be filled. If no -s is
      specified, the second colour is the border colour at which filling
      should stop.

      The optional [filename] specifies a bitmap .BMP file that is
      8 by 8 pixels in size and is used as a fill pattern.

    /drawtext -hnrpboc @ <colour> [colour] [fontname fontsize] <x y [w h]> <text>

      This draws text at the specified co-ordinates.

      The -p switch processes and interprets colour/bold/etc. codes in
      the text.

      The -b switch indicates that you have specified a second colour
      as the background colour for the text.

      The -o switch means the specified font should be in bold.

      The -c switch means that you have specified the [w h] values as
      the rectangle in which text should be printed. Text will be
      clipped if it extends beyond this rectangle.

    /drawscroll -hn @ <x> <y> <x y w h> [<x> <y> <x y w h>...]

      This scrolls the region inside the specified rectangle. The first
      <x> and <y> parameters represent the distance to scroll and can
      be positive or negative.

    /drawcopy -ihnt @ [colour] <x y w h> @ <x y [w h]>

      This copies part of a picture to a different position in the
      same window or to another window. If the second [w h] parameters
      are specified, the picture is stretched/squeezed to fit.

      The -t switch indicates that you have specified a [colour] RGB
      value as a transparent colour in the source bitmap.

    /drawpic -ihntsc @ [colour] <x y [w h]> [x y w h] <filename>

      This loads and draws a Bitmap .BMP picture at the specified
      co-ordinates. If the first [w h] are specified, it is stretched
      or squeezed to fit. The second [x y w h] rectangle specifies
      which portion of the loaded bitmap should be displayed ie. a
      bitmap could contain multiple pictures.

      The -t switch indicates that you have specified a [colour] RGB
      value as a transparent colour in the specified bitmap.

      The -s switch indicates that you have specified the first [w h]
      parameters (as explained above) to squeeze/stretch the bitmap.

      The -c switch indicates that the bitmap should be CACHED. This
      greatly speeds up subsequent references to this bitmap. If you
      specify -c and the bitmap is already in the cache, it is loaded
      and used from the cache, otherwise it is reloaded from the file.
      You can clear the entire cache with /drawpic -c.

      If you try to load and cache a bitmap and there are already 30
      bitmaps in the cache, the bitmap with the lowest reference count
      is freed and replaced by the new bitmap.

      If you try to load a bitmap and there isn't enough memory, mIRC
      repeatedly frees the least referenced bitmap and tries to load
      again.

    $pic(filename).size,width,height

      This returns the size, width, and height of a bitmap file.

    menu @ {
      mouse:/echo mouse moved at $mouse.x $mouse.y
      sclick:/echo single click at $mouse.x $mouse.y
      dclick:/echo double click at $mouse.x $mouse.y
      drop:/echo drag and drop at $mouse.x $mouse.y
    }

      The mouse event is triggered when you move a mouse inside a
      picture window. You can use the $mouse identifier (below) for
      the x and y position of the mouse.

      The sclick event is triggered when you click inside a picture
      window. It will trigger even if you double-click. The dclick
      event is triggered when you double-click inside a picture window.

    $mouse.x,.y,.key

      The $mouse identifier can be used in the mouse/click events.
      For $mouse.key you can use the & bitwise operator to check if
      the left button, shift key, and/or control key are pressed.

      eg. if ($mouse.key & 1) echo left button is pressed

    $click(@,N).x,.y

      This stores a history of x,y clicks for a window. You can use
      /clear -c @ to clear the history of clicks for a window. If you
      use $click() with no properties it returns x y.

    $inrect(x,y,x,y,w,h)

      This returns $true if the point x y is in the specified rectangle,
      and $false if it isn't.

    $rgb(N,N,N)

      This returns an RGB value for use in the above commands. If you
      use only ONE parameter, it assumes it is an actual RGB value and
      returns N,N,N.

    $getdot(@,x,y)

      This returns the RGB value of the pixel at the specified position.

128.Added Control-F Find text search dialog for use in text windows.
129.Fixed /ignore -p ignoring a users actions to a channel instead of
    only in private messages.
130.Fixed channel listbox selection bug, was leading to items in listbox
    being selected spuriously in certain situations.
131.Added identifiers $sin(N), $asin(N), $cos(N), $acos(N), $tan(N),
    $atan(N), where N is in radians, $log(N), $sqrt(N).
132.The channel name is now displayed in a CTCP if you received it via
    a channel message.
133.Fixed Bold/underline/etc. bug in text display.
134.Keyboard messages are now processed correctly for desktop windows.
135.Fixed bug relating to messages being incorrectly highlighted.
136.Added properties to $window(N/@) identifier, now includes:

    $window().x,y,w,h,dw,dh,bw,bh,mdi,title,state

    x,y    the left and top corner position
    w,h    the width and height of the window
    dw,dh  the width and height of the text/graphic display area.
    bw,bh  the width and height of the bitmap for a bitmap window
           this may not be the same size as the display area.
    mdi    $true if window is mdi, otherwise $false
    title  the text in the titlebar
    state  minimized/maximized/normal/hidden

    If you specify -1 as the window name, w and h will return
    the width and height of the screen.
137.Fixed floating point number checking routine, was treating a
    single . as the value zero.
138.Fixed conflicting shortcut keys in several dialogs.
139.Added Minimize to Tray option in Extras dialog. This option is
    only available under win95 with the 32bit mIRC.

    If the option is unchecked, you can force mIRC to minimize to
    the tray by holding down the SHIFT key when you minimize mIRC.

    If the flash option is triggered, the icon flashes.

    If you right-click on the icon a popup menu with your current
    queries/channels appears, those that have a checkmark next to
    them have had their icons highlighted due to incoming messages.
    You can click a menu item to open the window.

    If you hold down the SHIFT key when you quit mIRC, the next time
    you run it, it will be minimized.

140.Added $portfree(N) identifier, returns $true if the specified
    port number is not in use, otherwise returns $false.
141./splay and notify can now handle LFN sounds.
142.If you hold down the Control key when clicking on a windows tab
    in the switchbar, the window is minimized.
143.Extended $maddress() so you can specify the Nth matching address,
    eg. $maddress(address,N). The old format is still handled.
144.Fixed identd bug which was disabling identd in certain situations.
145.If your directories for DCC Get, Logs or Sounds are the main mIRC
    directory, mIRC creates a download directory for DCC gets, and asks
    if you want a Logs/Sounds directory created for you. Existing .log
    or .wav and .mid files are moved from the main directory into their
    respective directories.
146.Leading spaces are now stripped from a $read line.
147.Added support for DALnets /nick <nickname> [password] command.
148.Can now hold down Alt-Key while pressing enter in a multi-line
    editbox to enter separate lines.
149.If you use /load to load a file that is already loaded, its
    contents are updated and its position in the processing order
    is maintained.
150.Added /mkdir <dirname> and /rmdir <dirname> commands.
151.Fixed bug in Identd, Finger, and DCC Servers which was causing
    them to miss incoming connections if many came in quickly at
    the same time.
152.Lines in the channels list are now stripped of control codes
    before being scanned for the match text.
153.Fixed file creation routines not setting the correct read/write
    file attributes in certain cases.
154.If you /server <group> and the group doesn't exist, mIRC assumes
    it's an address without a domain and tries to connect to it.
155.Fixed out of bounds number processing gpf bug, out of bounds
    error calculations now return $null.
156.Fixed drag-drop bug.
157.It is no longer possible to alias the /unload command.
158.Can now press Alt+1...9 key combination to switch to the Nth
    window in the Window list. eg. Alt+1 is the status window. You
    can also use Alt+0 to switch to the main mIRC window from an
    mIRC desktop window.
159.Fixed toolbar bug which was preventing keypresses from being
    processed when the tooltip was displayed.

26.Server IP Address lookup method is now different, it gets the IP
   address from the actual connection so it doesnt have to look it
   up, and after connecting it looks up the named address with a
   /userhost. For new IRCnet servers, mIRC uses the address in the
   numeric 001 when first connecting instead of /userhost.

57.Fixed popup menu bug which was resulting in processing of lines
   following the end of a definition.
58.If no dclick item is specified in a menu script, mIRC uses the
   /command definition of a @window for the double-click.
59.Fixed /help passing parameters.
60.Fixed on dns ip address bug.
61.Added $ltimer identifier, returns number of last started timer.
62.Added $email identifier, returns email address in setup dialog.
63.Fixed any ctcpreply beginning with "PING" being interpreted as
   a ping reply.
64.Added (v1 isletter v2) comparison, where v1 is a letter in the
   list of letters in v2 (v2 optional).
65.Added $ignore(N/address) identifier, with .type property.
66.Added /sline [-a|r] #channel N/nick command.

78.Added Address Book which replaces the Uwho dialog. You can use the
   command /uwho <nick> as usual to /whois a user, or you can use the

   Can display pictures only in BMP format. You can pop up the Address
   book with Alt-B.
79.Can now /list <#channel[,#channel,...]> to list just the specified
   channels.
80.When you manually turn on logging for a window you can now specify
   a log filename which will be remembered across sessions until you
   turn logging off. Turning off logging for a window is now also stored
   across sessions, so once you turn it off it needs to be manually
   turned on again later (the auto-log option won't override it).

   gotos, etc. now report line number/filename.

   is cleared.
87.If you press the Up/Down key to view the previous/next line in an
   editbox, and you are at the bottom of the editbox, the current line
   is first saved. If you're at the bottom of the buffer and you press
   down, the editbox is cleared.
88.Can now specify a range of lines with /dline, eg:
   /dline @name N[-N2]   delete lines N to N2

    variables button when viewing the variables section.

    routine by over 50%, in some cases it may be close to 100% decrease.
    There is a slight increase in script processing speed, but this
    change should mainly affect mIRC running under NT.
105.Fixed $asc() bug.
106.Added -s switch to /play command, allows you to play commands to
    status window, and can now also /play while not connected to server.

    a line separator.
114./wallchops command is now translated into the /onotice command.
115.Can now queue multiple /dns requests. If an address is already in
    the DNS queue, it is not added again.

    Note: because of the way the DNS lookup works, any DNS related
    requests currently in progress eg. connecting to a server, must
    be resolved before subsequent requests. This means that if a prior
    DNS is having problems resolving, subsequent DNSs have to wait
    until it times out before they can be resolved.

116.Added auto-overwrite option for DCC Gets.
117.Changed DCC Options dialog into a tabbed dialog for more space.
118.Added events on 1:QUERYOPEN/QUERYCLOSE:/echo $nick $address. Note
    that $address may not always be available.

    also set correctly with the @ prefix.
120.For DALnet 4.4.11 & Undernet 2.10 or higher /onotice now sends
    message in the format: /notice|/msg @#Channel.
121.Custom Menubar on|off is no longer an option. If there is popup
    text in the Menubar section of the Editor, the menubar will be
    displayed automatically.
122.Fixed rubbish text appearing in Editor dialog when switching from
    Users/Variables to a script section via the View menu.
123.When selecting File/New in Editor dialog, any changes in the current
    editbox are now remembered.
124.Can now use /savebuf [-s|-f] etc. to save status/finger buffer,
    a window name should not be specified.

    logfile: channel topic, topic set by, channel URL, and channel
    creation time.
126.URL catcher now doesn't chop off addresses with ? and = in them.
127./partall now works offline.
128.Added /dqwindow [on|off|show|hide|min] which allows you to change
    the dedicated query window setting, and to manipulate the window.
129.When listing info on a specific channel eg. /list #mIRC, your
    channels.txt file is not over-written.
130.Fixed handling multiple lines pasted into editbox and parsing
    by on INPUT event.
131.Added /winhelp <filename> <key> command for opening help files.
132.Added -h switch to /aline/dline/etc. line commands which highlights
    the icon of the window in which the change is being made.
133.Added $timezone identifier, for the 32bit version the return value
    depends on timezone setting in Windows, for the 16bit the return
    value depends on the TZ environment variable in your autoexec.bat.
134.Fixed /timer -o switch bug.
135.Added mIRC DCC server, listens by default on port 59 for special
    mIRC DCC connections. To turn the DCC server on/off you can use
    the command:

    /dccserver [+|-scf] [on|off] [port]

    You can send/chat/fserve the DCC server using the DCC Send/Chat
    dialogs and specifying an IP address instead of a nickname (you
    can also specify both a nickname and IP address, mIRC will use
    the ip address to connect).

    From the command line, you can use /dcc [send|chat|fserve] with an
    IP Address instead of a nickname to initiate a connection to the
    DCC server. Note: /dcc fserve only works for IP connections and
    does not work via IRC.

    Chat Protocol
      Client connects to Server and sends:
      100 clientnickname
      When Server receives this, it sends:
      101 servernickname
      Connection is established, users can now chat.

    Fserve Protocol
      Client connects to Server and sends:
      110 clientnickname
      When Server receives this, it sends:
      111 servernickname
      Connection is established, user can now access fserve.

    Send Protocol
      Client connects to Server and sends:
      120 clientnickname filesize filename
      When Server receives this, it sends:
      121 servernickname resumeposition
      Where resumeposition is between 0 and filesize, and is required.
      Connection is established, and Server DCC gets the file.

    Get Protocol
      Client connects to Server and sends:
      130 clientnickname filename
      When Server receives this, it sends:
      131 servernickname filesize
      When Client receives this, it sends:
      132 clientnickname resumeposition
      Where resumeposition is between 0 and filesize, and is required.
      Connection is established, and Server DCC sends the file.

      Notes:
      a) The Get protocol has been implemented in this way mainly
         because I'm assuming:
         1) The client may not be able to open a socket to listen
            for and accept a connection (firewall etc.)
         2) The DCC server may only be able to listen for connections
            on port 59 (firewall etc.)
         3) Since the client was able to connect to the DCC server the
            first time, it should have no problem connecting to the
            same port again.

      b) Currently the Get Protocol is ONLY used by the fileserver when
         a user (who has connected to a fileserver via the DCC server)
         requests a "get filename". All other attempts to Get a file via
         the DCC server are ignored.

    If server receives unexpected information, or doesn't recieve info
    15 seconds after initial connection, it closes the connection.

    If service is unavailable, server sends:
    150 servernickname

    If server rejects connection, it sends:
    151 servernickname

136.Fixed timer().time bug.
137.Fixed $duration() bug.
138.Can now specify multiple @window names with the "menu" prefix in
    remote scripts, eg.:

    remote events.

142.To force /uwho to lookup a users idletime/awayinfo/etc. you can
    now use /uwho nick nick (just like /whois).

    for the specified window.
144./splay can now play LFN filenames.
145.Fixed appending _ to a filename when a dir of the same name

   }

   You can also add sub-menus to the channel, query, nicklist, and
   menubar popups. All loaded scripts are scanned for menus to add.
   For custom windows you can use:

   menu @window {
     [dclick /command]
     <menuitems>
   }

   You can specify @window as the popup filename when creating the
   window with the /window command. The dclick specifies the command
   that should be performed when a user double-clicks in a @window.
   The line-number of the line that was clicked is in $1 for listboxes.

   2) you're an Op, 3) the user exists, before acting.
28.You can now specify different files for each popup menu.
29.Can now save alias/popup/remote files as plain text (non-INI
   format) by not specifying an .ini file extension.

   NOTE: You can't save multiple sections to a plain text file!
   So if you have all remote sections in remote.ini and want to
   save them as plain text, you'll need to save each section to
   a separate file. Same goes for aliases/popups.

     b = update horizontal scrollbar width for listbox
     c = close window
     d = open as desktop window
     e = editbox
     l = listbox
     n = minimize window
     o = if opened on desktop, place ontop
     r = restore window
     s = use a sorted list
     x = maximize window

   @name     = window name (must prefix with a @)
   x,y,w,h   = left top width height
   popup.txt = popup filename, loaded when needed
               (must be a plain non-ini text file)
   /command  = default command
   font/size = font name and size (defaults to status window font)

   You can also use /window to manipulate some of the above
   settings for an existing custom window.

   You can use the following commands to manipulate lines:

   /aline [-cN] @name text     add line to list
   /dline       @name N        delete Nth line
   /iline [-cN] @name N text   insert line at Nth line
   /rline [-cN] @name N text   replace Nth line
   /sline       @name N        selects Nth line

   Where -cN allows you to specify the line colour.

   You can use the $window(N/@name) identifer to access the
   following custom window information:

   $window(N).x      left
   $window(N).y      top
   $window(N).w      width
   $window(N).h      height
   $window(N).state  minimized/maximized/normal

   To access the lines in a custom window you can use:

   $line(@name,N)    returns Nth line
   $sline(@name,N)   returns Nth selected line (listbox only)

40.Can now /load popups with these switches:
   -ps status popup
   -pc channel popup
   -pq query/chat popup
   -pn nicklist popup
   -pm menubar popup
41.Fixed indexing bug with alias/popup/remote processing.
42.[removed]
43.mIRC now stores relative (instead of full) file/directory
   paths, if a path lies inside the mIRC directory.
44.Made (most) buttons the same size.
45.Parameter identifiers changed to:

   $n     for parameter n
   $n-n2  for parameters n to n2
   $n-    for parameters n onwards

   $parm has also been discontinued, you can use the above
   to refer to remote parameters from now on.

   Note: This version of mIRC still supports the old $1 and
   $parm for now but only the above is documented.

46.Added (v1 isvo v2) comparison to check if user v1 has a
   voice on channel v2.
47.Fixed $numeric not being set when matching any raw event.
48.Added /loadbuf and /savebuf commands.

    /loadbuf [lines] <window> <filename>
    /savebuf [lines] <window> <filename>

   Where [lines] indicates the number of lines you want to
   load/save from the end of the file.
49.Can now prevent message display for /ignore, /auto, and
   /protect with the . prefix.
50.Alias/popup/remote dialogs can now be resized and will
   remember their size/position.
51.The alias, popup, and remote dialogs have been redesigned
   to cope with various improvements (see below).
52.You can now load multiple alias files.
53.To /load, /unload, /save files you can use:
     /load <-a|-pscqnm|-ruvs> filename
     /unload <-a|-rs> filename
     /save <-pscqnm|-ruv> filename
54.The remote dialog and script routines have been improved.
   The format of definitions has changed to:

   ctcp 1:PING:/echo etc.
   on   1:JOIN:#:/echo etc.
   raw  1:*:/echo etc.

   This allows all of these to be intermixed in a single
   script file. The remote dialog has been altered to cater
   for only 3 types of files: Users, Variables, and Scripts.

   You can load as many script files as you require. Events
   will trigger all script files as independent scripts.

   You can also define aliases in a script by using the
   "alias" prefix:

     alias test /echo this is a test alias!

   You can also enter initialization commands which are run
   when a script is *first* loaded by using:

   on 1:LOAD:{ etc. }

   And initialization commands which are run whenever mIRC
   is first run (and loads scripts automatically) by using:

   on 1:START:{ etc. }

   The START section also runs after the LOAD section when
   a script is first loaded.

   If a script is loaded from within the remote dialog, auto-
   run commands are not executed until the dialog is closed.

   The above allows a whole script of ctcps, events, and raw
   and it's related aliases and initializations to be edited
   and distributed in one file.

   Note: mIRC automatically splits your current remote.ini
   into separate files and translates the ctcp, event, and raw
   entries into the new format. To convert old files into the
   new format use the Convert option in the Remote dialog and
   load them in as an INI file because mIRC will need the
   header info eg. [commands] [events] [raw] to know how to
   translate them.

   $ial(mask,N).nick nickname
   $ial(mask,N).user user id
   $ial(mask,N).host host
   $ial(mask,N).addr user@host
   This returns the Nth address matching "mask" in the IAL.
   Specify zero for total number of matching addresses. To
   scan the whole of the IAL you can use $ial(*,N). If N is

   its subdirectories are searched for the specifed wave filename.
   This allows users to organize their sounds into subdirectories
   without having to worry about directory paths.
22.Added 1:ON DNS:/echo $nick $iaddress $naddress $raddress event.
   If /dns <nick> was used then $nick refers to <nick> otherwise
   it refers to your own nickname. $iaddress refers to the ip
   address, and $naddress refers to the named address. $raddress
   is the resolved address. If $raddress is $null then that means
   that the address could not be resolved.
23.Fixed @ (must be channel Op) prefix for remote definitions
   preventing a definition from being performed if the event is
   not a channel event. eg. @1:ON TEXT:*:*:/etc. which reacts

   are available. eg. if someone downloads a servers.ini file.
34.Now allows you to configure a separate Popup menu for use
   in a channel window. If no channel popup menu is defined it
   defaults to using the status window popup menu in a channel.
35.When marking text for copying, the marked block is not cleared
   if new text is printed in the window, instead the scrollbar
   is updated to indicate there is new text below. If you were
   at the bottom of the buffer when you started copying, mIRC
   will automatically scroll down to the bottom of the buffer
   after you finish copying.
36.I added an /echo -a switch which echos to the active window.
   If the active window is not a status, channel, or query/chat
   window, it defaults to the status window.

   refers to a channel that both you and the user that triggered
   the event are on, on which you are an Op.
38.Fixed small bug with /set.
39.Can now do /log [on|off] [windowname].

      0-9  (0x30-0x39)
      A-Z  (0x41-0x5A)

61.Rewrote text mark/copy routine.
62./timestamp [-a|e|s] [on|off] [window] is now used for turning
   on/off timestamping in windows. If only on/off is specified
   with no window, the global timestamp switched is turned on/off.
   -s = for status window
   -a = for active window
   -e = for every window
63.For ctcp commands, $chan is now filled with a channel name if
   you received the ctcp via a channel.
64./flood now ignores *!*@site.
65.$active identifier now returns window names more intelligently.

    $chat(N).status    active, waiting, inactive

    $fserv(N)          nickname
    $fserv(N).ip       ip address
    $fserv(N).status   active, waiting, inactive
    $fserv(N).cd       current directory

    $get(N)            nickname
    $get(N).ip         ip address
    $get(N).status     active, waiting, inactive
    $get(N).file       filename
    $get(N).size       filesize
    $get(N).rcvd       bytes rcvd
    $get(N).cps        chars per second
    $get(N).pc         percent complete

    $send(N)           nickname
    $send(N).ip        ip address
    $send(N).status    active, waiting, inactive
    $send(N).file      filename
    $send(N).size      filesize
    $send(N).sent      bytes sent
    $send(N).lra       last rcvd ack
    $send(N).cps       chars per second
    $send(N).pc        percent complete

70.Can now create your own identifiers, eg. in the aliases section
   create an alias:

     add { %x = $1 + $2 | return %x }

   And then use it in a command //echo Total is: $add(4,21)
   Can define as many parameters as you want: $add(1,2,...,N).
   Built-in identifiers of the same name have priority.
71.Added "default port" setting to setup/options dialog.
72.Can now use /timer [-o] etc. to start an offline timer. Offline
   timers are not stopped if you are disconnected from the server,
   however all other timers are. If you are not connected to a server
   and you try to start a timer, it defaults to being an offline timer.
73.Chat and Query MDI switches are now separate.
74.Alias, Popup, and Remote editboxes now remember their cursor

77.If an address that is in the auto-unban list of the /ban command
   is unbanned manually, it is removed from the unban list.
78.PONGs from users are now ignored.
79.Using new method to lookup Local Host and IP Address. mIRC now
   connects directly to server and issues a /userhost nickname to
   lookup users address and then does a /dns to resolve the IP
   address. This means that a user isn't prevented from connecting
   to a server if there are any local host lookup problems and it
   also means mIRC will be using a named address that has been
   verified by the IRC server so there should be no problem looking
   up the IP address. The DCC Send/Chat toolbar buttons are enabled
   the moment the lookup is completed successfully.
80.Now uses /userhost instead of /whois to look up addresses from
   the server.
81.The /run command now uses a different method to run files, it
   allows you to run files based on association as well.
     eg: /run notepad.exe readme.txt   or   /run readme.txt
   It also uses this new method to view .txt files in the help
   menu as well as in other parts of mIRC.
82.Can now do /who <channel> <address> and only users on the
   specified channel are displayed.
83.Fixed bug with variable not being evaluated if preceeded by
   the text "set" in a line.
84.Now also using new faster indexing method for IAL.
85.Fixed empty [ ] brackets gpfing.

   also includes time taken and cps.
88.Fixed "error sending data" message at end of DCC send.
89.Variables can handle spaces a bit better now eg. single
   spaces, preceeding spaces, etc.
90.Fixed "fake" PONG messages being displayed.
91.Added support for bold/underline/reverse characters. Can
   use Ctrl-B,U,R to insert these characters into an editbox.
   If you first mark text in the editbox, it will be enclosed
   in starting and ending control characters, otherwise one code
   will be inserted. If you hold down the shift-key, two codes
   are inserted and the cursor positioned between them. You can
   also use Control-O to insert a reset character which turns off
   all the above settings.
92.Added support for colour characters, use Control-K to insert
   a colour control char (0x03) into text in an editbox.

   eg. if * is the control char then:

    *     Selects Default Text and Background
    *1    Selects Colour 1 for Text, Default Background
    *1,5  Selects Colour 1 for Text, Colour 5 for Background

   Colours currently range from 0 to 15.
93.Added flood protect options tab to options dialog.
94.For an ON QUIT event, a users name is now removed from
   all channel listboxes *after* this remote event has been
   processed, not before it.
95.Added $strip(text) identifier which strips out all bold,
   underline, reverse, and colour control codes from text.
96.File dialog defaults to showing ini, txt, or wav files
   depending on file being selected.
97.Fixed multiple IRCop-greeting bug thingy.
98.Fixed notify update bug.
99.Fixed ON TEXT $chan being filled with users nickname when
   trigger is a private message.
100.Added a switchbar to allow easy switching between windows.
    If you click on a button with the left mouse button and
    the window is minimized, it is restored, if it is already
    restored, it is minimized. If you click with the right mouse
    button, the windows system menu pops up. You can turn the
    switchbar on/off in Options/Extras dialog.
101./ban won't allow you to initiate a ban if you don't have Ops.
102./amsg and /ame now don't send an individual message for each
    channel etc.
103.Page up/down now works in channel listbox.
104.Channels dialog, "Limited to" option allows more digits.
105.ctcp ECHO is no longer replied to.

    instead of orange, all other colours should look exactly the

    matches in certain situations eg. * at end of a string.
112.Changed ordering of masks to:

    Type 0: *!user@host.domain
    Type 1: *!*user@host.domain
    Type 2: *!*@host.domain
    Type 3: *!*user@*.domain
    Type 4: *!*@*.domain
    Type 5: Nick!user@host.domain
    Type 6: Nick!*user@host.domain
    Type 7: Nick!*@host.domain
    Type 8: Nick!*user@*.domain
    Type 9: Nick!*@*.domain

    The mask types for all routines and identifiers are now identical.
    /guser /dns etc. commands all default to type 6 which is the same
    mask as before.
113.When mIRC is in the process of doing a channel listing and it
    receives a "server load to high" numeric 263, it now resets the
    channels list button and other related parameters.
114.Ignores DCCs to a channel.
115./userhost with no reply is now displayed.
116.Added "on top" option for switchbar.
117.Added $duration(seconds) identifier.
118.Added $nofile(filename) which removes the filename and
    only returns any remaining path.

    directory and its subdirectories for the specified file and
    returns the full path and filename if it is found.
120.Added /ial [on|off] command.
121.Added token handling identifiers:

    $addtok(text,token,C)     - adds a token to the end of text but
                                only if it's not already in text.
    $findtok(text,token,C)    - returns Nth position of token in text
    $gettok(text,N,C)         - returns Nth token in text
    $instok(text,token,N,C)   - inserts token into Nth position in text
                                even if it already exists in text.
    $remtok(text,token,C)     - removes 1 matching token from text
    $reptok(text,token,new,C) - replaces 1 matching token with new
                                token in text

    $gettok() replaces $token(), however $token() is still
    supported for this version.

122./ulist now searches the whole of the users level list for
    a matching level.
123.A user level can now be a word, for example:

    2,5,op,9,prot:*!*@host

    op:ON JOIN:#:/mode $chan +o $nick

    Named levels are = levels ie. they work exactly the same
    way that = levels work.
124.Added strip options to options dialog. These strip out
    control characters from incoming notices and messages.
125.Fixed memory/socket reading bug.
126.Pressing Enter in the parameters dialog without entering
    any text now returns $null.
127.Kick, Part, Quit messages have Control-O appended to them.

    mode settings itself so there's no longer a delay.
129.ON MODE reacts to initial mode lookup when mIRC first
    joins a channel.
130.Rewrote /auser & /guser routine. Code is cleaner, same
    speed, works better eg. doesnt allow redundant levels,
    and fixes bugs in the old routines.
131.Added wildcard halting of timers. eg. /timer?* off
132.Fixed messages to #host.mask.

    $chan(N/#).mode    mode
    $chan(N/#).key     +k key
    $chan(N/#).limit   +l limit

    $mode() and $topic() are no longer supported. However
    $channel() is still supported for this version.
136.Support for the :> redirection in remote definitions has
    been removed.
137.Added /strip [+-burc] command.
138./wavplay command has been replaced with /splay command,
    which can play both .wav and .mid sound files. Can also
    use "/splay stop" to stop a .mid file playing. /wavplay
    is still supported for now. 
139.The /sound command and related options (ON NOSOUND, etc.)
    can now work with .mid files as well as .wav files.
140.Improved/simplified code in the install program.

2.Fixed :> redirection.
3.Fixed separator handling in popup menus.
4.ON SNOTICE can now be prevented from displaying info.

   as commands, eg.:

   1:DO:$parm2*

12.Fixed the -s switch in /echo.
13.Fixed $readini with missing parameters gpfing.
14.$read and $readini now return $null if a line isn't found.

   has already been evaluated. eg.:

   set %x %y
   set %y Hiya!
   /echo [ [ %x ] ]

16.DCC Send, Get, Chat, and Fserv now use different Icons.
17.The = switch in remote definitions 1:COMMAND:= wasn't

21.Fixed $asctime() gpf bug.
22.DDE USERS now prefixes nicknames with @ or + if necessary.

   use the /remini command which takes the same parameters.
24.Added $exists(filename) to check if a file exists,
   returns $true or $false.
25.Added -n switch to $read which prevents the line read in
   from being evaluated or parsed ie. it's treated as text.

   is limited to around 60 characters.
28.Fixed extra separator lines being added to certain popup
   menus occasionally.
29.Now allows you to DCC chat yourself.
30.Now saves URLs to the urls.ini file.
31.Added $maddress which specifies the currently matched
   user address for an event in the remote:

   1:TEST:/echo $fulladdress matched $maddress

   And added $maddress(address) which returns a matching
   address from the remote user list:
32.If the filename specified in $read has no path, it defaults
   to the mirc.exe directory (like all other commands).
33.Can now /load -r and /save -r (raw definitions).
34.Added Load/Save items to URLs pop menu which let you
   load/save any URL file.

   displayed.
39.Fixed memory bug in fileserver.
40.Improved memory allocation in copy/paste routine.
41.Displays /whowas reply with @ in address.
42.The aliases for .hlp files added to the Help menu now have
   the lowest command precedence ie. if an existing alias or
   command of the same name exists, the .hlp alias is never run.
43.Now also adds .txt files to the dynamic help menu.
44.The IAL is updated a bit more intelligently to allow
   remote definitions to access nicknames that have just
   joined/left a channel.
45.Fixed time-out gpf bug which affected Send/Get/FServ.
46.Now triggers ON PART when *you* part a channel.

   first opens.
49.Fixed GPFs occurring when viewing URLs.
50.Fixed "me:" prefix for remote definitions.

53.Added option "Only show notifies in notify window".
54.Fixed "Bad Username" server reply if new user entered an
   invalid email address (the userid part was being used
   in the identd server).
55./echo 1 $asc($mid(3,1,hi there)) was returning 0 for a space,
   now returns 32.
56.Added "fast screen update" option to Extras dialog. This
   speeds up text printing by updating the screen after each
   "batch" of text instead of each line.
57.Moved "Ignore" to first position in Control dialog.
58.Added a new flood protection method. Just use
   /flood [on|off] to turn it on and off.

   lines now.
60.Added option "Show finger requests" to Options dialog
   in Servers section.
61.Fixed /oper with wrong password GPFing (?)
62.Prefixing a command with . prevents it from displaying
   its usual message (apart from error messages).

   DCC Send/Get windows.
67./halt can now prevent the usual text output of raw
   numeric events (for most events).
68.Added $bnick identifier which refers to the nickname
   of the user being banned. This is not always filled
   since sometimes a nickname isn't specified with a
   banmask.
69.Now displays all user modes in status window titlebar.
70.Improved display of info for unknown numerics.
71.Fixed status window not closing when it's opened as
   desktop window and mIRC is exited.
72.Added $ulevel and $clevel which store the remote user
   and command levels that matched for an event.
73.The channels list is no longer stored internally but
   completely stored in and accessed from the channels.txt
   file.
74./remote [on|off] now affects the raw section as well.
75.Can now do /raw [on|off] to turn the raw section on
   and off.
76.Fixed mode event -l or -k skipping parameters in a
   mode change.
77.Notify window now displays note next to each nickname.
78.Tweaked INI routines.
79.When an error occurs in a DCC Send/Get/Chat, the DCC
   window is now closed if "auto-close" is selected in
   DCC options.
80.Added ON NOSOUND event triggered when someone sends you
   a SOUND request and the sound doesn't exist.

   1:ON NOSOUND:/msg $nick I don't have $filename

81.Changed toolbar buttons appearance.
82.Can now do /partall <message>
83.In ON NICK event when you change your nick, the $me
   identifier is only updated after remote definitions have
   been processed.

   dialogs, etc. This might affect a few things since &
   and + are now special prefix characters.
85.Now saves Servers in servers.ini file.
86.Tweaked DCC Send/Get routines and fixed problem with
   DCC windows not displaying the correct information in
   certain situations.
87.Standardized INI prefix to "n" for all saved information.
88.Results from a /who and /whois are now used to update
   the Internal Address List if the user is on a channel
   which you are on. eg. /who #channel.

102.Added identifiers $mode(#) and $topic(#) which return
    the mode/topic of channels which you're currently on.

    the number of times string2 occurs in string1.
104.Speeded up remote processing a bit.
105.DCC Get problem for netcom users fixed.
106./links now displays links list properly on ircd 2.9.1 which
    sends the list in reverse order (are we surprised? ;)

    number of nicks in your notify list. The minimum pause time
    is 20 seconds, the maximum pause time is 50 seconds.
108.An alias cannot call *itself* anymore (except indirectly by
    calling another alias which calls it).
109.Improved editbox processing routine slightly: now processes
    text entered into it even if another window is active or
    on top of it.
110.Added /close -icfgms [nick1] [nickN] which closes windows of
    the specified type and nicknames. If no nicknames are given,
    all windows of the specified type are closed.
    i = only close inactive windows (doesnt apply to message windows)
    c = chat
    f = fserve
    g = gets
    m = message windows
    s = sends
111.Removed /closechats, /closefserves, /closedccs commands. These
    are replaced by the /close command.
112.Removed /maxdepth command.
113.Added $timestamp identifier returns time in [xx:xx] format.

122.The TAB key nickname list now only stores the nicknames of people
    who sent you normal query/channel messages, not ctcps.
123.Fixed /timer bug.

    variables beginning with %test.
125./alias now tells you which alias it's adding/removing.
126.Fixed gpf bug when low number values are used with time
    related commands/identifiers.

17.Now allows /group, /enable, and /disable commands to be
   used with the RAW section.
18.Changed description of Protect option which said it worked
   with addresses.. it can only work with nicknames.
19.Added $lf = chr(10) linefeed and $cr = chr(13) return.
20.Added $lof(filename) which returns the size in bytes of
   the specified file.
21.Added $pos(string,substring) which returns the position
   of substring in string.
22.Fixed bug in remote when parsing { } brackets, was miscounting
   and skipping definitions.
23.Made remote routines less strict in the type of format
   they expect in definitions. eg. the :> redirection.
24.The channels.txt file now does not store channels that
   were excluded in the "Hide" parameters section.
25.Added $send(N) and $get(N) which return currently open
   send/get windows.
26.Fixed $chat(N) so it only returns the nickname of the user.
27.Now allows multiple channel names as variables, eg:

   1:ON JOIN:%chan1,#mIRC,%chan2:etc...

   Or you can do:

   1:ON JOIN:%channels:etc...

   Where %channels is a list of channels separated by commas.
   You can't *combine* these though.
28.Added $mask(address,type) which returns the address
   with the specified mask.

42.The default /list setting for minimum number of people
   on a channel has changed from zero to four.
43.Using /halt to prevent certain EVENTs from being displayed
   has been removed. It worked, but the order of display of
   information became non-intuitive and confusing. Will find
   a better way to do this for the next version.
44.Added $result identifier which stores the result of
   a /return <result>. The result can be a number between
   0 and 30,000.

30/06/96 - mIRC v4.5

Changes:
1.Major improvement of code in many places. mIRC
  now processes many things faster.
2.Fixed possible bug with invalid nicknames being
  added to nick list on a channel.
3.Fixed a bug in DDE routines which caused a gpf if
  external applications were too slow at processing
  DDE messages.
4.Rewrote remote routines, they now look much less
  like spaghetti and work better.
5.Can now use [ and ] evaluation brackets to control
  the order of evaluation of identifiers. Identifiers
  within brackets will be evaluated first, from left
  to right. You can nest brackets. This allows you to
  evaluate things any way you like...

  /notice $nick " $+ [ $read [ -s + [ $parm1 ] ] c:\text\note.txt ] $+ "
  /say % [ $+ [ $1 ] ]

  Definitions without evaluation brackets are evaluated
  the same way as before, though I've also improved the
  normal evaluation method slightly.
6.Fixed small $read bug.
7.Can now use server addresses in User list in remote.
8.Added MDI options dialog to the Window menu which
  allows you to specify for each individual window if
  you want it opened as an MDI or as an independent
  desktop window.
9.Standardised command error reply to: * /command: <message>
10.Can now use delete key to delete URLs in URL window
   and Insert key to add a new url.
11.Can now use Control-Tab to step through the different
   tabs in the setup and options dialogs.
12.Wrote a setup program which allows you to install mIRC
   in a directory of your choice, creates backups of your
   current files, validates the zipped files to make sure
   they're not corrupted, and adds icons to the program
   manager for you.
13.Improved DCC Send file dialog, can now select more than
   nine files at a time to DCC send.
14.Fixed scrollbar sometimes not being positioned properly
   in certain windows.
15.Added /titlebar command which allows you to change the text
   in the titlebar on the fly.
16.Added protect list to options dialog, now works
   exactly like auto-op command, can specify channels
   for each nick.
17.DCC Send/Get/Chat are now fully dynamically allocated
   structures ie. there is no limit on the number of DCCs.
   This speeds up DCC send/get processing a lot. This also
   fixes a few small bugs related to the way the older
   structures were being used.
18.Improved the DCC Send/Get transfer windows, they now
   give information such as time taken, estimated time
   for transfer, characters per second, etc., and a
   progress bar.
19.Window sizes for Chat/Server/Send/Get windows are now
   saved seperately for each type of window.
20.Added ON BAN remote event, works like ON OP.

   5:ON BAN:#tree:/mode $chan -b $banmask

21.Added option to Links window popup menu which lets you
   switch between displaying links as plain text or
   in a listbox.
22.Wildcard routine now allows ? character to match any
   single character, the * is used as normal to match
   multiple characters. This affects matching text in
   ON TEXT, etc. as well as user addresses. Also fixed a
   small bug that was causing mismatches in certain cases.
23.Now allows multiple channels in a remote event
   definition:

   1:ON OP:#moo,#help,#test:/notice ...

24.Now allows %variables to be used in the text and
   channel positions of an event definition:

   1:ON TEXT:%text:%channel:/notice etc ...

   You can also use %variables for ctcp command names:

   1:%variable:/notice etc...

25.Added a RAW section to the remote which catches NUMERIC
   events. This has it's own separate editbox because if
   mIRC had to scan your whole remote events definitions
   for each numeric event, things would slow down to a
   crawl.

   322:*mirc*:/echo 2 $parms

   This would print all lines which have the word "mirc"
   in them when you do a channels /list (this is a pretty
   intensive test).

26.Fixed bug with notify list not being updated correctly
   when a user changed nicknames.
27.For remote events and ctcp commands you can now prevent
   the normal text associated with that command from being
   displayed by using the /halt command.

   1:ON JOIN:#mIRC:/echo 3 #mirc [Joins $nick] | /halt

   So from now on when anyone joins channel #mIRC, only
   that text is displayed in the channel.

   Be warned: you can use this to prevent query windows
   from opening, plus other things which mIRC usually
   does for an event (though nothing critical).
28.Window structures are now fully dynamically allocated
   so there is no limit on the number of windows which can
   be opened. This also speeds up processing quite a bit.
29.Now allows alias, popup, and remote definitions like:
   <prefix definition> {
     /command1 ...
     /command2 ...
     /command3 ...
   }
   One line definitions are handled the same as before.
   The characters { } now have special meaning so you
   can't use them as normal text anymore.
30.Major improvement of memory usage in command parser.
31.Added "View" URL option in channels list popup menu
   which extracts and views a URL immediately.
32.Added a /goto command which can be used in { } definitions.

   /greet {
     /set %x 0
     :retry
     /inc %x
     /goto %x
     :2
     /echo bye!
     /halt
     :1
     /echo hi!
     /goto retry
   }

   You can also use a variable as a goto name, eg.

   :%jumppoint

   if you "/set %jumpoint 5" then you can do "/goto 5"
   and mIRC will evaluate %jumpoint to 5 and jump to it.

33.You can now use the /return command to finish processing
   an alias command and to allow any default processing to
   continue. eg.

   1:ON JOIN:#mIRC {
     /echo 3 #mirc [Joins $nick]
     /return
     /echo 3 #mirc I'm not printed!
   }

34.Added "Always On Top" setting to system menu of windows
   when they are opened as desktop windows.
35.Text in status, queries, and channels windows is now
   rewrapped to fit the window whenever a window is resized
   or a font is changed.
36.Added two new events:

   1:ON FILESENT:*.txt,*.ini:/echo Sent $filename to $nick ( $+ $address $+ )
   1:ON FILERCVD:*.txt,*.ini:/echo Received $filename from $nick | /run notepad.exe $filename

   These only react to successful DCC transers.
37.Added /writeini command and $readini identifier which use
   the built-in INI routines to write/read standard INI files.

   /writeini <inifile> <section> <item> <value>
   $readini <inifile> <section> <item>

   These will allow better control of storage of different
   types of information into different sections in a file.
38.Now allows aliases to call other aliases, or even to call
   themselves recursively. As a safeguard against infinite
   loops, the default maximum recurse depth is set at 10. This
   can be changed with the /maxdepth command. The minimum
   depth allowed is 1 (aliases can't call other aliases) and
   the maximum is 100. Calling aliases from within aliases
   uses quite a bit of memory, so this might cause problems
   in certain situations where memory is low etc.
39.The /links window now has the save buffer option in the
   system menu.
40.Now supports Drag-and-drop files onto channel, channel nick
   listbox, query/chat, and notify windows. Can define aliases
   for each type of dropped file, as well as different aliases
   if the Shift key is pressed when the file is dropped. See
   Drag-drop tab in options dialog.
41.The /set /unset /inc /dec commands now default to not
   displaying information unless called directly from the
   command line. To force them to display info, you can use
   the [-s] switch eg. /set -s %x 1
42.Improved the copy routine slightly... if lines being copied
   originally belonged to the same line, then they are combined
   instead of separated. If you want to force mIRC to copy text
   exactly as it appears in the window then hold down the SHIFT
   key when you do the mark/copy.
43.In remote, instead of using the * prefix for commands to
   be performed only when you're an Op, you can now use the @
   sign. Both are handled, but I will only specify the @ in
   the documentation since it makes more sense.
44.Increased maximum items for popup menus from 300 to 600.
45.Now ignores any mirc.ini in the windows directory and uses
   the mirc.ini in the current mirc.exe path.
46.Invalid CTCP messages are not replied to anymore.
47.Fixed a small time-out bug related to DCC send/get/chat.
48.New Identifiers:

   $abs(N) returns the absolute value of number N.
   $chr(N) returns the character with ascii number N.
   $asc(C) returns the ascii number of the character C.

   $len(text) returns the length of "text".

   $upper(text) returns "text" in uppercase.
   $lower(text) returns "text" in lowercase.

   $left(N,text) returns N left characters.
   $right(N,text) returns N right characters.
   $mid(S,N,text) returns N characters starting at S.
   $str(N,text) returns "text" repeated N times.

   $token(N,C,text) return Nth token separated by character C
                    (C is the ascii number of a character)

   $lines(file) return number of lines in specified file.

   $nick(N,#) returns Nth nickname on channel #.
   $snick(N,#) returns Nth selected nickname on channel #.
   $opnick(N,#) returns Nth Op nickname on channel #.
   $nopnick(N,#) returns Nth non-Op nickname on channel #.

   $channel(N) returns the Nth channel that you are on.
   $query(N) returns the Nth query window you have open.
   $chat(N) returns the Nth DCC chat window you have open.

   $notify(N) returns the Nth notify nick currently on IRC.

   For the above identifiers you can specify N as 0 (zero)
   to get the total number of nicks/channels/etc. for that
   identifier.

   $snotify   returns notify nick currently selected in
              notify list box.

   $level(address) finds a matching address in the remote
                   users list and returns its levels.

   $away returns the value $true or $false.

   Identifiers/variables can be placed inside the brackets.

   Example: /echo $right(3,$left($len(goats),ToMooOrNotToMoo))

49.Added a simple /if statement...

   /if v1 operator v2 { ... }
   /elseif v1 operator v2 { ... }
   /else { ... }

   Example:

   if (((%x == 2) || (%y >= 3)) && ($1 == $parm1)) { echo match1! }
   else if ($len(%input) == 5) { echo match2! }
   else echo no match!

   If/elseif/else can all be nested inside each other. You
   should use () and {} brackets to make sure that you're
   terms are evaluated correctly though you don't *have* to
   use them.

   Using brackets also speeds up processing quite a bit since
   mIRC then knows exactly what it has to evaluate.

   Available comparisons:

   ==    equal to
   !=    not equal to
   <     less than
   >     larger than
   >=    larger than or equal to
   <=    smaller than or equal to

   //    is a multiple of
   \\    is not a multiple of

   isin  string v1 is in string v2
   iswm  wildcard string v1 matches string v2

   ison  nickname v1 is on channel v2
   isop  nickname v1 is an op on channel v2

   isnum number v1 is a number in the range v2
         which is in the form n1-n2 (v2 optional)

   ischan if v1 is a channel which you are on.

   isauto  if v1 is a user in your auto-op list for
           channel v2 (v2 optional)

   isignore if v1 is a user in your ignore list with the
            ignore switch v2 (v2 optional)

   isprotect if v1 is a user in your protect list for
             channel v2 (v2 optional)

   isnotify if v1 is a user in your notify list.

   To negate the above you can prefix them with an !
   exclamation mark.
50.In all definitions, you do not need to specify the
   / command character any more for commands since it
   is really only needed when typing commands into the
   editbox. This also means you don't need to specify
   the / when defining aliases, etc. See 51.
51.Variables or identifiers that don't evaluate to a value
   now return the value $null so they can be used in the
   if statement for checking etc. eg.

   listops {
     echo 4 * Listing Ops on #
     set %i 1
     :next
     set %nick $nick(%i,#)
     if %nick == $null goto done
     if %nick isop # echo 3 %nick is an Op!
     inc %i
     goto next
     :done
     echo 4 * End of Ops list
   }

52.When entering text in an editbox you can now hold down
   the CONTROL key when pressing Enter and the text will be
   sent as plain text even if it begins with a command
   character. This will also work when you paste text into
   the editbox.
53.Text in Alias, Popup, and Remote ediboxes is now auto-
   indented when { } brackets are encountered.
54.Enlarged DCC Chat dialog to make it easier to use.
55.You can now use an = (equal sign) to assign values to
   variables.

   %x = 5 + 1
   %x = 5 - %y
   %x = %x * 2
   %x = %z / $2
   %x = %x % 3

   Can only perform a single operation in an assignment
   at this time. You can also still do /set %x 5 + 1.
56.Added $ctime identifier which returns total number of
   seconds elapsed since 00:00:00 GMT, January 1, 1970. This
   can be used with PING to find out how many seconds it took.
57.Added ON CTCPREPLY to listen for replies to ctcps. eg.:

   1:ON CTCPREPLY:PING* {
     if ($parm2 == $null) echo [ $+ $nick PING reply]
     else {
       %pt = $ctime - $parm2
       if (%pt < 0) set %pt 0
       echo [ $+ $nick PING reply] %pt seconds
     }
     halt
   }

58.Identifer $active returns the full name of the currently
   active window.
59.Added Font button to alias, popup, and remote dialogs
60.mIRC now automatically gets your web browsers path and
   name from the registry if it's there.
61.Channels list is now saved to a file "channels.txt" and the
   channels list dialog now has "Apply" and "Get List" buttons.
   If "Get List" is pressed then a list is read from the server,
   if "Apply" is pressed then the latest list is used whether in
   the channels listbox or in the "channels.txt" file. The date
   time and server name are also stored in this file.
62.Added "Save to file" item in channels list popup menu which
   allows you to save the currently displayed list to a file.
63.Added "PORT" item to DDE which returns the current irc
   server port you are using.
64.If userid in identd server is empty then mIRC assumes you're
   a new user and automatically fills in the userid from the
   email address you entered and turns on the identd server.
65.Can now use the /quote command to do the same thing as /raw.
66.Now supports server-side filtering on UNDERNET channels for
   the minimum and maximum number of users on a channel. This
   means that you will only receive a list of channels which
   match your choices for these two criteria.
67.Can now use Alt-J to pop up the channels folder dialog.
68.Speeded up display of Channel nicknames listbox. This actually
   affects quite a few other things in mIRC since the channels
   listbox was being used to store the nicknames for each channel.
   Now the nicknames are stored internally. Any command or
   identifier that involves checking/using nicknames is now far
   faster than before.
69.Now sounds an event beep when a chat that you initiated
   makes a connection.
70.Can now set a string variable to an empty string with "".
   eg. set %name ""  or  %s = ""
71.Text in the alias/popup/remote dialogs is now displayed
   quickly.
72.The Wait cursor is now used in more places to give a
   better indication of when mIRC is busy doing something.
73.Can now select multiple files in the Log File listbox
   to make deleting files easier.
74.For $read and /play you no longer need to specify the
   number of lines in a file on the first line of the file.
   If you do, mIRC will use the number and will work faster,
   if you don't mIRC will count the lines itself.
75.Can now use Control-Break to break out of a currently
   executing alias in case it's in an infinite loop, etc.
76.mIRC now defaults to using aliases.ini, popups.ini, and
   remote.ini files if these files aren't specified in mirc.ini,
   and if these sections aren't found in mirc.ini. If these
   files don't exist, mIRC will create them.
77.Added /alias command which allows you to add and remove
   aliases from the aliases list. Only works for *single line*
   aliases.
78.Colour now works in DCC Chats.
79.Speeded up Tab display in setup and options dialogs.
80.Fixed Editbox bug when pressing enter and text isn't sent.
81.DDE Server now defaults to ON with service name MIRC.
82.Added "CONNECT" DDE topic, which connects you to a server and
   joins a channel. The data format is: irc.funet.fi,6667,#mIRC,1
   where the last digit is a 1 or 0 indicating whether you want
   mIRC to be activated or not. This is an XTYP_POKE.
83.Converted some routines to assembly to increase speed.
84.Added $asctime() which converts the value returned by $ctime
   or a PING into a full date in text format.
85.Added support for ctcp UTC.
86.Now ignores DCC-related ctcps sent to a channel.
87.Shift-F1 now pops up the keyword search dialog for the help file.

1.Fixed /sound being limited to eight character
  channel/nick names.
2.Fixed mirc.ini file being corrupted in
  certain situation.

  of all servers in the network and allows
  easy connecting, etc.
5.Fixed character | bug in nicknames/userids.
6.Fixed small ON CHAT bug.
7.Fixed DCC Get minimize button not remembering
  setting.

   work with more dialogs.
19.Fixed small identd and finger bug.
20.Added fileserver warning dialog to warn
   new users.
21.Added $hfile identifier which is like the $file
   dialog except it lists files horizontally.
22.Fixed fileserver "read" command bug.
23.Added option to display identd requests.
24.Improved mark/copy text routine a bit.
25.Remodelled about dialog.
26.Fixed socks firewall access.
27.Added $++ identifier which works the same as
   the $+ identifier but does the concatenation
   after the previous item has been evaluated, so
   something like this works now:
     /say " $+ $read c:\test.txt $++ "
28.Auto-join on invite now ignores invites to
   channel 0. (/join 0 makes you part all channels,
   seems to be an irc server feature).
29.Finger window is restored if it is minimized
   when you try to do a finger.
30.Changed /list command so you don't have to prefix
   the wildcard text with a #. eg. /list help
   and /list *help* is turned into /list help
31.Now displays /whois Idle time in hours/minutes/
   seconds format instead of just seconds.
32.Clicking on "Arrange Icons" now places icons
   behind open windows when arranging them.
33.Now shows both server name and Port number
   when connecting.
34.Status window default height is now larger.
35.Now handles "erroneous nickname" better.
36.If no directory is specified in the wave filename
   for the /wavplay command, it now defaults to the
   wave directory specified in the Sound Requests
   options dialog.
37.Other things.

20/03/96 - mIRC v4.0 (final version)

Changes:
1.Fixed standard editbox popup menu under 95 not
  being displayed on a right mouse-click.
2.Fixed problem with /ctcp to a user with "dcc"
  in nickname.
3./query command pops an existing window to the
  front if it's hidden.
4.Fixed "parameter dialog" popping up bug.
5.Fixed Channel Dialog gpf bug if kicked while
  dialog still open.
6.Dynamic help menu now displays a list of .hlp files
  in mIRC's directory, as well as the readme.txt,
  versions.txt, and update.txt files, for quick
  access. Also adds internal aliases that match
  these filenames, so if you have "winsock.hlp" in
  the help menu you can type /winsock <topic>. The
  menu is always updated before it is displayed.
7.[removed]
8.Added "play wave" options to event beeps section.
9.Now remembers DDE settings across sessions,
  added to "Servers" section in options dialog.
10.Added "Popup notify window on connect" option.
11.Added new configurable menu which allows you to
   add a menu to the main menu bar. This menu has
   the functionality of both the main, query,
   and nickname popup menus, and allows you to
   define commands that work in different types
   of windows.
12.Can now test for and prevent SOUND ctcp's
   in the remote.
13.Fixed channel list "Hide" parameters being
   erased in certain situations.
14.Modularized Tab dialog routines so now they're
   "completely" independent of the rest of the code.
15.Improved setup dialog/server selection:
   a) Added "group" definition to servers. When sorting
      the servers list this groups servers with the
      same group name together.
   b) Added "connection retry" options. One second
      delay inbetween connect retries.
   c) Can select multiple servers to connect to.
   d) Can do "/server groupname" which will cycle through
      all servers of group "groupname" when trying to connect.

   NOTE:
   When using the 16bit mIRC, winsock will "freeze" sometimes
   when cancelling a connection. This is because winsock has
   to timeout... as far as I know, mIRC can do nothing about
   this since it is built-in to winsock, so even if mIRC
   cancels a connection, winsock still waits for 10 seconds
   *anyway* before completing the cancellation. This might
   result in other problems.

16.Added "Popup channel folder on connect" option.
17.Now capitalizes the first word in a ctcp message.
18.Notify:
   a) Now has it's own window in options dialog.
   b) Number of nicks is unlimited.
   c) Allows little notes for each nickname.
19.Added /commands [on|off], turns remote commands on/off.
   /events [on|off] turns only events on/off, and
   /remote [on|off] now turns both commands and events on/off.
20.Added other beep/close options to DCC options dialog.
21.Fixed $parms bug, was only storing first 256 chars.
22.Added "Place ? marked urls at top of list" option in url options.
23.Can now do "/ignore -auN", which unignores the
   specified address after N seconds. Can now also do,
   /ignore -apcnti, where p=private,c=channel,n=notice,
   t=ctcp,i=invite.
24.Can now enter auto-op addresses with channels,
   eg. nick!user@address,#mirc,#mircplus
25.All /dde commands are now buffered and sent at intervals
   specified by the DDE delay option.
26.Added /clearall command which clears buffers of all
   status, channel, and private windows.
27.Now warns you if you try to quit mIRC when there are
   DCC Transfers in progress.
28.[removed]
29./links command results are now displayed in a coloured
   tree fashion to make it more readable (?)
30.Added "pop up setup dialog on startup" option.
31.Improved speed of text display slightly.
32.Fixed /rlevel not removing levels in certain situations.
33.Added -s<text> option to /write command, scans file for a
   line beginning with <text> and writes to it.
34.[removed]
35.Added /groups [-e|d] command which lists all, enabled,
   and disabled groups in remote definitions.
36.Can now use #$?#="etc." which will ask for a channel
   name if you try to use the command in a non-channel
   window, otherwise it uses the channel name of the
   currently active channel window.
37.Command parsing routine completely rewritten, much
   more robust and evaluates identifiers etc. more
   intelligently now. However, because of increased
   processing/checking etc. this routine is now slower
   than the older routine.
38.Moved identd server options to setup dialog.
39./speak command requests are now also placed
   in delayed DDE queue.
40.Added variable support:
   /set [-q] <%var) [value]
   /unset [-q] <%var> [%var2] ... [%varN]
   /unsetall
   /inc [-q] <%var> [value]
   /dec [-q] <%var> [value]
   Can be edited in Variables section in remote dialog.
41.Iconized Notify and Url windows are now highlighted
   whenever their contents change.
42.Notify and URL toolbar buttons are now also highlighted
   if either the window isn't open or isn't active.
43.Fixed /ctcp nick VER bug.
44.Fixed beeping bug where mIRC wasn't beeping properly
   for some users.
45./sound now doesn't require you to specify a message.
46.Added $level which represents users level in remote.
47.Added /remove <filename> which deletes the specified file.

   in a fileserver session (Used in ON SERV event).
49.Specifying a nickname in the finger dialog now works
   the same way as /finger <nickname>.
50.Can now use /nick while not connected to server:
   /nick <nickname> [alternate]
51.Fixed bug in resolving dns addresses.
52.Fixed /finger not resolving for some users.
53./auto and /ignore now *add* an address by default,
   to remove an address you can use the -r switch.
   ie. they do not toggle anymore.
54.Added Firewall option, doesn't allow DCC's through
   a firewall yet though.
55.Added "IP method" option for users with different
   winsock setups.
56.Fixed DCC Sending a file with the same name as users
   nickname (would result in an error message).
57.Fixed URL sorting in url window.
58.Now tests to see if DCC send filename is a system device,
   if so DCC send is ignored.
59.Fixed & characters in editboxes in options dialog
   being messed up.
60.Fixed disappearing INI and temp files not being removed (?)
61.Fixed "read" in fileserver allowing read access to files
   outside home directory.
62.Fixed occasional "notice" gpf.
63.Fixed ctcp TIME missing trailing ^A.
64.Fixed Status window saving/reset not working.
65 Can now specify -sgroupname on the command line.
66.Other bits and pieces.

19.Fixed '=' prefix processing bug in remote.

28/12/95 - mIRC v3.9

Changes:
1.Fixed the /join KEY bug.
2.Add -q switch to /raw which makes the /raw command
  work "quietly", not printing out what it's sending.
3.Fixed channel folder dialog not remembering
  added/deleted channels when pressing OK.
4.Now /ignores invites as well.

10.The 32bit under 95 now saves logs and buffers using
   the full length filename.
11.ON TEXT etc. now allow wild card matches using
   multiple * in the match text.

   NOTE: the text matching routine in ON TEXT etc.
   doesn't use the = sign anymore, as it's now redundant.

12.Found bugs in the wildcard matching routine while
   making ON TEXT work with it. Fixed.
13.Made Tabs in options dialog more 95-ish. The bold
   font is still there though, sorry, I like it!
14.mIRC now does NOT reply to unknown ctcp messages,
   it just prints them in your window as usual and
   then ignores them (as per the RFC).
15.Aliases now work better when called from remote
   definitions.
16.Fixed -l# switch in play command.
17.Improved positioning of various dialogs.
18.DALnet URL catching on joining a channel now works.
19.Nicks in notify list are no longer forced to lowercase.
20./save can now be used in an alias with | separators.
21.Added -stext option to $read, which scans the specified
   file for a line beginning with the specified text.
22./pop delay is now randomly *close* to the number you
   specify as a delay.
23.Fixed /server N (specifying server number).
24.Fixed window bug possibly related to DCC gpfs.
25.Added -u# switch to /ban command which specifies delay
   time before unbanning the specified ban. Minimum delay
   time is 10 seconds. If no number is specified, it defaults
   to 30 seconds. eg. /ban -u15 nick
26./fingering a nick now only adds the nick's address to the
   fingered addresses list, not the users whole irc address.
27.Now allows an unlimited number of /timers.
28.Fixed INI specification on command line.
29.Improved dynamic memory allocation in various places.
30.Added notify list window. Can use the toolbar notify button
   or /notify [-sh] to show/hide the window. Please note that
   there is a minimum window width under 95 that I haven't
   been able to override.
31.Address returned by IAL was sometimes invalid. Fixed.
32.Added [-ar] switches to /notify, /protect, /ignore,
   which forces the command to -add or -remove a nick
   instead of toggling it.
33.Added $site identifier for remote addresses.
   eg. for user@host
   $site = host
34.Now allows /sound in DCC chats.
35.Added minimal DDE support, as well /dde command and
   a $dde identifier, to be expanded. See DDE section in
   help file for description
36.Added "Edit" button for editing finger file in options
   dialog.
37.Can now access popup menus in the notify, URL, and channels
   list window through the keyboard. Pressing RETURN performs
   a "double-click", pressing SPACE pops up the popup menu.
38.Added Alt-N for notify and Alt-U for URL windows.
39./msg command now by default doesn't switch to the
   window you're sending a message to unless you specify
   the [-s] switch. eg. /msg -s hiya!
40.Added /timestamp [on|off] command.
41.Added /partall command which parts all the channels
   you're currently on.
42.Added "Minimize DCC get window" option.
43.Added $adate (for US style month/day/year),
   and $fulldate which spells it all out.
44.Added a "time to activate" option to the /timer
   command, eg. /timer1 11:30 1 1 /say It's now 11:30am
45.Fixed "filename" in quotes with no spaces bug.
46.Fixed using $?="text" identifier.
47.Added $file identifier, eg. in a popup menu item:
   Play Wave:/wavplay $file="Select a Wave!" c:\waves\*.wav
48.Fixed disappearing aliases/popups/remote bug, where
   filenames for each of these were being reset to the
   mirc.ini file.
49.Added a "/timers off" switch which allows you to turn
   off all active timers.
50.Alt-L now pops up the Channels List dialog.
51.Added /disconnect command, hard disconnect from server
   without a /quit.
52.Fixed ON SNOTICE reacting twice to server notices.
53.Fixed/Improved other bits and pieces.

25/11/95 - mIRC v3.8

Changes:
1.Added option to show invites in active window.
2.Fixed $! bug.
3.Added option to auto-resume existing files.
4.Fixed /echo with invalid parameters gpfing.
5.Option dialog now remembers it's "view" across
  sessions.
6.Paused op wasn't clearing a nick from it's list
  immediately if a nick parted or quit, but had to
  timeout first.
7.Added /speak <text> command which uses monolog
  to speak the specified text.
8.Added /dns <nick/address> which resolves addresses.
  If mIRC sees a "." in the name you specify it assumes
  it's an address and tries to resolve it. Otherwise
  it assumes it's a nickname and does a /whois to
  find the users address and then looks it up. If you
  give it an IP address, it looks up the host name.
9.Removed small users window in remote dialog, now
  using one big window for users, commands, and events.
10.The Add Dialog has been discontinued. Check out the
   alias, popup, and remote dialogs for the improvement.

   IT IS *HIGHLY* RECOMMENDED THAT THE ALIAS, POPUP,
   AND REMOTE SECTIONS BE SAVED SEPERATE FROM THE
   MAIN MIRC.INI FILE FROM NOW ON. THE MIRC.INI
   CAN'T HANDLE THE STORAGE OF LARGE AMOUNTS OF
   INFORMATION AS REQUIRED BY THE ALIAS, POPUP,
   AND REMOTE SECTIONS.

11.Finally fixed DCC Send/Get windows sometimes
   not auto-closing at end of transfer (?)
12.Right-clicking in a non-active window will now
   bring it to the top and make it active.
13.Fixed socket error message when running second
   copy of mIRC (didn't actually affect anything).
14.For new users, mIRC no longer copies the mirc.ini
   to the windows directory but leaves it and uses it
   in the same directory as the EXE. However, if it
   finds an mirc.ini in the windows directory it will
   use it (to remain compatible with older users).
15.Small fixes relating to Function keys.
16.Can now use /load -apuce <file.ini> or
   /save -apuce <file.ini> to load and save aliases,
   popups, and remote sections from the command line.
   NOTE: You can only refer to one section at a time,
   so you can't do /load -ap some.ini.
17.All memory in the parsing and remote routines is
   now allocated dynamically.
18.Added ignore options to DCC send/chat in the DCC
   options dialog. Can also use /sreq and /creq
   (send request and chat request) with the parameters
   [ ask | auto | ignore] from the command line.
19.Added "ON CHAT:text:/msg ..." and ON SERV events to
   scan text in DCC chat windows and fileserver windows.
20.Added command line option to connect to a server and
   join channels which is more of a standard WWW link
   definition: //server:port/#channel,#channel
21.Fixed gpf problem for some users when quitting mIRC (?)
22.Added /flush [levels] command. This clears the remote user
   list of nicknames that are no longer valid. For each nick
   in the user list that matches the specified levels mIRC
   checks to see if that nick is on any of the channels that
   you are currently on. If not, the nick definition is removed
   from the user list. If you do not specify [levels] then
   mIRC clears all nicks from the user list that don't exist
   on channels you are on.
23.Added "me" prefix to remote definitions, eg.:
   me:1:ON JOIN:/msg etc...
   This limits a command definition to reacting only to
   events caused by your client. This is useful in case you
   use Bots which have the same address as you.
24.The address in the Finger dialog now defaults to
   the last address which was fingered.
25.The /play command has been improved in a major way, 
   it can now queue requests (see the help file!)
26.Fixed bug with highlighting in query windows.
27.Added Finger server (must be set up in a certain
   way, see the help file on how to do this).
28.Added ON SNOTICE event, which listens for server
   notices and can filter them ie. prevent them from
   being displayed.
29.Remodelled the setup dialog. Can now also store
   an unlimited number of servers.
30.If /finger sees a "." in the parameter you give it, it
   will assume it's an address and will finger it, otherwise
   it will assume it's a nickname and will do a /whois on the
   nick to find their address and use that for the finger.
31.Added option to change tooltip delay.
32.Split the "Beep on window message" option into two...
   "Beep on channel message" and "Beep on query message".
33.Fixed the notify bug which would result in mIRC telling
   you all the people on your notify list are on... then
   off... then on... then off...
34.Simplified /timer code and fixed a small bug in it.
35.Command line window buffer has increased to 30 lines.
36.Now catches server numeric 328 for URL description
   when joining a channel on DALnet (they might not have
   implemented this yet).
37.Fixed toolbar buttons colours when the default system
   colours are changed.
38.The 32bit mIRC can now DCC send/get LFN's with spaces
   in them. Unfortunately, other clients won't be able to
   receive these properly! See the "DCC Send" section in
   the help file which explains the problem.
   You can also do: /dcc send nickname "this is a.text file"
39.Added -nnick1,nick2 command line option which sets
   your nicks to these values.
40.Overhaul of irc and parsing routines, simplified and
   speeded up.
41.Added [on | off | close] to /url command to turn on/off
   catching urls and to close the URL window.
42.Added option "Show modes in channel".
43.Now gives the reason why you can't join a channel.
44.If you have "rejoin channel when kicked" turned on
   and you are kicked, mIRC will keep the channel
   window open while it tries to rejoin and will only
   close it if it can't.
45.If a /play filename doesn't have a directory spec. it
   defaults to the mirc.exe directory.
46.Added a flexibile /write command which writes lines
   to a file.
47.Added "Show queries in active channel window" which
   shows private messages from other users in a channel
   window without opening a query window.
48.Added "TAB" key putting "/msg nickname" into the editbox
   where "nickname" is the nick of the last person who
   messaged you. If you press TAB repeatedly it cycles
   through the nicks of the last five people who messaged
   you.
49.Now shows who set the topic and at what time when you
   join a channel on Undernet and DALnet.
50.Fixed small bug with the /sound command not checking
   properly if a sound file exists.
51.The Options dialog now uses Tabs. I had trouble using
   existing TabDialog DLL's, so I coded my own Tab
   display routines.
52.Fixed /channel dialog bug which would occur if you
   typed /channel repeatedly while it was in the middle
   of retrieving the channel info.
53.Fixed a problem with /whois replies, the format of
   the reply has changed and is hopefully clearer now.
54.Can now also define Shift and Control Function key
   definitions.

24/10/95 - mIRC v3.72

Changes:
1.Fixed $parms not being passed in a redirection.
2.Can now /play to any channel/nick without needing
  to have that window already open.
3.Added -ttopic option to /play which looks for the
  specified [topic] in a text file and plays it to
  the specified nick/channel.
4.Added $pnick identifier which refers to the nick/channel
  which is currently being played to, so you can use it
  in /played commands.
5.Allows #$parmN to force a parameter to be a channel.
6.Fixed DCC Resume filesize bug.
7.Added option to show notifies in active window.
8.Completely reorganized the Options dialog as it was
  too crowded and it was getting harder to add new options.
  Now divided into sections, and also incorporates the
  options in the extras, url, sounds, and identd dialogs.
  The menus and toolbar buttons have been re-organized
  accordingly.
9.Fixed QUIT bug when exiting mIRC while still connected.
  It was sending a part instead of a quit to the server.
10.Fixed /timer not releasing it's memory in certain
   situations.
11.Fixed positioning of : in some raw commands.
12.Fixed setting of focus to windows.
13.Added option to dump joins/parts to status window.
14.Now shows DCC transfers percentage/size at head
   of window title for win95 users.
15.Messages from irc ops of the form $address or
   #address are now displayed in the server window
   in pretty purple as opposed to opening up a query
   window.
16.Added "clear list" button to DCC chat dialog (the
   DCC Send dialog uses the same list).
17.The /pop delay value can be up to 15 seconds now.
18.The weird DCC Send dialog bug was fixed (?)
19.Improved copy/paste routine memory allocation.
20.Fixed /sound with invalid parameters gpfing.
21.Fixed some toolbar colours not being displayed
   correctly for some buttons.
22.Number of channels in channel list window is now
   shown at beginning of title.
23.Text printed with the /echo command is now wrapped.
24.Added $r(v1,v2) identifier, returns random number
   or letter between v1 and v2.
25.Fixed identd server time-out bug.

12/10/95 - mIRC v3.7

Changes:
1.An *iconified* channel list window is not restored
  if a /list is done, instead it's icon is placed above
  current windows (without focus) for easy access.
2.The Join Channel dialog can now handle multiple
  selections.
3.The /timer can now work with aliases again.
4.Can now prevent an identifier from being evaluated
  the first time through the alias routine by prefixing
  it with a ! for example: $!read, $!url, $!me, etc.
  This allows you to use it in a /timer command if you
  want the identifier to be re-evaluated every time.
5.Fixed /channel dialog bug and improved memory
  allocation for the ban list.
6.Fixed bug in status window sizing.
7.Fixed Timer dialog bug, when selecting cancel
  timer wasn't being reset correctly.
8.Improved grouping of switches in options dialog.
9.Fixed "disconnected" bug while trying to connect
  to another server if already connected to one.
10.Cleaned up popup menu routines.
11.Major improvement in robustness of input,
   general irc, and remote routines.

            BACKUP YOUR MIRC.INI FILE(S)

12.Wrote my own read and write INI routines for parts of
   the mirc.ini file since the standard INI routines
   were too slow. Loading and saving is almost instant now.

13.Fixed windows not being saved/closed properly on exit.
14./play now works when used in remote commands.
15.Added /echo command which prints text in the specified
   window (for debugging purposes).
16.Now using 0x04L in dialog definitions so that
   3D dialogs under win95 are automatic.
17.Can now do "/server N" where N is the Nth server
   in the server list.
18.Fixed font selections not being saved correctly.
19.Added URL catcher window which automatically catches
   URLs from text in channels etc. and stores them in
   a listbox. You can then send a URL to your WWW browser
   directly through mIRC. Type /url [-d] to open the window.
   Use -d to clear all ? marked items before showing the list.
20.If a nick in the notify list is prefixed with a + sign
   a /whois is done on it on a notify.
21.Added sounds dialog and a new /sound command which
   allows multiple users on a channel to hear sounds at
   the same time (assuming they have the same wave files).
   format: /sound [nick/channel] <file.wav> <message>
22.Fixed problem with % in channel names (and other things).
23.Fixed channel dialog "Key already set" bug.
24.Added $url identifier which references the currently
   active URL in your WWW browser.
25.Added option in extras dialog to redefine command char.
26.Now automatically sets cursor to last edited window in
   remote and popup dialogs.

         *** NOTE NOTE NOTE IMPORTANT CHANGE ***

27.Now uses a different format for commands/events:
   Old format: 1:PING:/notice *1:$nick hi there
   New format: 1:PING:/notice $nick hi there
   This greatly simplifies processing, the routines
   are now probably more than twice as fast as before.
   mIRC will automatically detect and convert old format
   definitions on startup (and when /add is used).

28.mIRC now maintains an internal list of nick!user@address
   for all users that are on the same *channels* as you. Whenever
   a /guser, /ruser, or /ban is issued, the internal list is
   searched first to find the nick's address. If no match is
   found, the normal /whois stuff is done.
29.Now opens log files in shared mode.
30.The nickname in the DCC Send dialog now defaults to
   the last nick to which a file was sent.
31.Added $snicks which returns a list of the selected
   nicks in the current channel listbox. The list is
   in the form: nick1,...,nickN, so you can only use it
   in commands which take multiple nicks.
32.Greatly improved/simplified address matching routine.
33.Can now do /ignore <nick> [type] which looks
   up the specified nick's address by doing a /whois,
   same as the /auser, /ban, etc. commands.
34.DCC Get dialog now allows you to specify a different
   directory for the incoming file.
35.In the setup dialog, a server is highlighted after
   it is added to the server list.
36.The nickname in the DCC Chat dialog now defaults to
   the last nick that was chatted to.
37.Aliases can now be called from popup, remote, timer,
   play, and any other definitions. You can now also call
   several aliases on one line seperated by a | like normal
   commands. eg. 1:HELP:/help1 $nick | /help2 $nick
   (Aliases still can't call other aliases).
38.Can now have up to 30 timers, also improved memory
   allocation for timers.
39.Fixed bugs with the /add command.
40.Fixed Clipboard missing last character bug (?)
41.Default directories for the file/dir dialogs
   weren't being set correctly.
42.The /notify command was checking twice instead
   of only once for nicks.
43.The /timer command now also remembers the parameter
   line that was around when the /timer was issued.
44.The 32bit mIRC should now handle LFNs okay.
45.Can now do level comparison for ON KICK, ON OP,
   and ON DEOP, prefix a line with <,>,<=,>=,<>,=
   compares levels of eg. kicker and kicked and only
   executes definition if true.
46.Attempted improvement and cleaning up of server
   oriented commands and their replies.
47."signon time" in a /whois on the undernet and dalnet
   is now shown correctly.
48.Can now specify a server on the command line
   eg. -sirc.server.addr:6667
   and mirc will connect to that server on startup.
   (You can combine this with the -j parameter to
   force it to join specific channels too).

13/09/95 - released mIRC v3.64 patch

1.Fixes the *1-3 type bug.

11/09/95 - mIRC v3.64

Changes:
1.Fixed Local Host and IP address bug, added options
  in the setup dialog. Now works for any combination
  of requirements for people with different types of
  internet connections (see Setup in mirc.hlp!)
2.$read command improved so you can specify
  a line number with [-l#]. For example:
  /silly /say $read -l5 silly.txt
  This will read line 5 of silly.txt.
3.Now using "Common Dialogs" for file/directory selection,
  as well as for the DCC Send dialog (Long filenames
  are NOT yet supported).
4.Optimized Remote routines - should be faster now.
5.Can now use $read in remote definitions. For example:
  1:TEST:/notice *1:$nick I said " $+ $read c:\langs\mirc\test.txt $+ "
6.Can now store up to 50 IRC server addresses in Setup dialog.
  Storage format in mirc.ini has changed, but will still read
  the old format.
7.Finger button now pops up a red flag while finger is busy.
  The flag disappears when finger has been completed.
8.Bug with Maximized mIRC window fixed.
9.Finger and Timer dialogs now popup under their
  respective buttons.
10.Added "Channels Folder" button which allows you to join
   a channel as well as maintain a list of your favourite channels.
11.Added "List Channels" button which pops up the List
   parameters dialog, allowing you to quickly list channels.
12.Fixed NT gpf bug when using toolbar.
13.Added -j<#channel> command line option. For example:
   mirc.exe -j#mirc,#friendly,#etc
   The specified channels will be joined on connect. You
   MUST have an mirc.ini with the "Connect on startup" option
   selected.
14.Fixed another bug with using * to begin a non-parameter
   identifier. eg. *host* in aliases/etc.

15.The /auser /guser and /ruser commands can now handle multiple
   levels. They have only been extended, so they are still
   compatible with your previous formats.

   /auser [-a] <level(s)> <nick | address>
   /guser [-a] <level(s)> <nick> [type]
   /ruser [level(s)] <nick> [type]

   For /auser /guser, the default is to replace any existing
   user with the specified levels (as usual). The [-a] option
   means add the specified level(s) to an existing users levels.

   The /ruser command removes the specified levels from an
   existing user. If all levels are removed for a user, the
   user is removed.

   See the Remote section in the Help file!

16.Can now do /mode # +oooo nick1 nick2 nick3 nick4
17./play can now be used in a remote/event definition.

18.Extended the /rlevel command to also work with multiple
   levels.

   /rlevel [-r] <level(s)>

   If the [-r] is NOT specified, it works as usual. If
   the [-r] IS specified, the specified level(s) are removed
   from users that have them. If a user's levels are ALL
   removed, the user is removed.

19.Fixed bug with Green box being drawn around iconized
   window in response to wrong messages.
20.Fixed several bugs in /play with using -r and -l.
   The format has changed slightly to:

   /play [-crl#] <filename> [delay]

   This now allows you to specify a delay for -r and -l,
   You must now specify the line number like this:

   /play -l24 file.txt 1000

21.Text colours are now ok when using > 256 colour setup.

31/08/95 - mIRC v3.6

Changes:
1.Highlight Box around an Icon now turns green if a highlighted
  word is spoken in a window.
2.Fixed Ping Pong bug which was preventing lines from being
  sent properly to the server.
3.Fixed Editbox/Colours bug in Extras dialog.
4.Inserting blank lines in Remote/events/aliases between
  commands would lead to loss of following definitions.
5.Channel list window would clear if you disconnected and then
  connected again.
6.Aliases, Remote Users, Commands, and Events definitions are now unlimited.
  ie. you can have as many as you want, however the limitation is the
  size of the editbox (around 30k?).
7.Fixed font dialog bug when tabbing with cursor keys.
8.Popups are still limited to 300 menuitems for each popup menu.
9.Max. length of a line in aliases, remote, and popups is approx. 600 chars.
  Same applies to lines in the Options dialog.
10.Now allows a non-op to change topic in channel dialog.
11.Fixed :) bug.
12.Fixed /auser /guser bug.
13.Fixed /channel dialog title bug.
14.Added a simple NON-configurable toolbar with tooltips.
   A Configurable toolbar would take a lot of work, so I probably
   won't get around to adding it (so don't ask! :)
15.Fixed ctcp PING reply missing a Ctrl-A at the end (?)
16.Specifying a /who *146.219* numerical address would mess up because
   the *1 is a parameter specifier. mIRC now checks to see if there is
   a . in the number, and if so it doesnt try to expand it.
17./play command can now play single lines randomly picked from
   a file (a specific line can also be specified). The format is:
   /play [-crl] [channel/nick] <filename> [delay/linenumber]
   Using -r means pick a line randomly, using -l means pick
   a specific line specified by linenumber. The first line in the
   file MUST specify the number of lines in the file. Any *1 $1 etc.
   identifiers CANNOT be used in the played line.
18.Added $read identifier which picks a line randomly from a file.
   eg. /say $read c:\funny.txt
       /kick # $1 $read c:\kicks.txt
   The first line in the file MUST specify the number of lines
   in the file. $read will insert ANY text, even commands with
   identifiers, and these will work like normal commands.
19.Added Fast Send checkbox to DCC Send dialog.
20.Fixed scrolling keys in Channel list and finger windows.
21.Made Font list longer in font dialog.
22.Added "auto-join on invite" option to options dialog. An
   auto-joined channel is initially minimized (this might not
   always work for various reasons...)
23.Added Function key support F1 to F12. Define in the alias
   window like a normal alias for example:
   /F1 /say Hello!
   /F5 /query $1   (for use on nick listbox in channel window)
24.Font width measurement for copy/paste wasn't correct for
   certain types of fonts.
25.Fixed problem with minimized windows being sized wrongly.
26.Fixed /channel bug. Now times out after 30 seconds, at
   which point another /channel can be issued. BUT if the old
   /channel command is replied to, your status window will fill

08/03/95 - mIRC v2.5a

Changes:
1.added "always retrieve local host" option for people who have
  dynamic IP addresses!
2.channel mode in title is permanently on. not an option anymore.
3.Added ctcp USERINFO command for compatibility. However, it returns
  the same information as a ctcp finger command.
4.moved some options to different windows were they made more sense.
5.added /finger and /auto commands.
6.fixed problem with releasing memory... popup menus weren't
  being freed properly so mIRC would lose as much memory as
  the size of the popup menus defined by the user. With the
  mirc.ini that comes with the program, this turned out to be
  3k+ of system resources everytime the program is run.
7.the MODE for channel mode changes gets messy when lots of
  mode changes occur. cleaned it up.
8.Window names in Window menu would not switch to the correct
  window when selected.
9.Text buffers for windows were not being freed properly.
10.Can now set the default font for the status/finger/list windows
   from their system menu. Only the DCC Send/Get windows have to
   be set from the font dialog window.

12.Commands such as /finger and /run can now be used off-line.
13.Corrected some mistakes in the mirc.ini file.

Changes:

  turn off the debug switch in the first release.
4.updated help file with description of previously coded but
