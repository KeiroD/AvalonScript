  during multiple simultaneous DNS requests in rare contexts.
9.Updated libraries to OpenSSL 1.0.1h.
10.Added Lock dialog option to disable SendMessage. If cMethod value
   16 is used for more useful error messages, returns 64 to indicate
   SendMessage is disabled. You can use $lock(sendmessage) to check
   if it is disabled.
11.Extended mouse wheel to work in interface elements, such as list
   boxes in dialogs, under the cursor even if they are not active.
12.Added /comlist command to list open com objects.
13.Added $servertarget identifier to return address specified in the

3.Fixed /loadbuf bug that skipped empty lines when loading a topic.
4.Changed HTTP routines to use POST with form parameters instead of
  GET with URL parameters.

  current search results instead of the full list.
6.Fixed while/if loop error reporting bug.
7.Fixed /hotlink -m menu not working correctly when a menu item is
  selected.
8.Fixed channel central limit bug that caused invalid limit values
  sent by the server to be stored incorrectly.

10.Fixed /timer bug when using the [time] parameter that caused it
   to execute twice on reaching [time].
11.Extended server/history popup menu so that if you hold down either
   the shift or control key and click, it opens a new server window.
12.Changed /localhost -p UPnP method to use local interface address

   Windows 8 tablet touch screens when using press-and-hold.
17.Fixed INI file save bug that was causing a gpf if the INI file
   was already in use by another application.
18.Fixed full screen menubar bug that caused the menubar to be
   displayed incorrectly in a multi-monitor setup in some cases.
19.Added /fopen -x switch that opens a file for exclusive access. If
   another application is using the file, /fopen will fail.
20.Fixed /hsave to an INI file not clearing section before writing
   hash table items to it.
21.Changed Options/Display/Buttons option to allow "Small" or "Large".
   This now changes both the toolbar and switchbar size. The size is
   scaled based on screen resolution and DPI settings. If installed
   on a tablet, the large button size is chosen by default.
22.Fixed /echo -h bug that caused text not to hard-wrap.
23.Fixed $ctime() bug where "nd" values were not being recognized.
24.Updated libraries to PCRE v8.35 and OpenSSL 1.0.1g.
25.Fixed $msfile() bug when too many filenames were selected under
   Windows 7/8.
26.Fixed $sdir() bug that caused selected folder not to be scrolled
   into view when dialog is displayed under Windows 7/8.
27.Added math identifiers $atan2(y,x), $hypot(x,y), $log10(x),
   $sinh(x), $cosh(x), $tanh(x).
28.Fixed $onpoly() bug due to rounding errors that may have returned
   $true in rare cases where two lines are very close.
29.Added $intersect(x1,y1,x2,y2,x3,y3,x4,y4,method) identifier that
   returns the point at which two lines/rays intersect. The method
   parameter is optional. If not specified, two lines are compared.
   If specified, it can be lr, rl, rr = line/ray, ray/line, ray/ray.
30.Fixed /drawdot bug that caused it to be drawn slightly off center.
31.Added $input() 'f' switch that forces the return of $no/$cancel
   for edit/combo boxes.
32.Fixed SSL certificate password dialog box being displayed multiple
   times when multiple SSL connections are in progress.
33.Added display of "Connect cancelled" message when a connection
   attempt/retry cycle has ended completely.
34.Added a single, standard lock/password dialog for use by all
   features to replace multiple older implementations.
35.Fixed SendMessage() WM_MCOMMAND bug that would have returned a
   successful result to the calling application even if the command
   had in fact failed.
36.Added support for encrypting server passwords in servers.ini. Old
   plain text passwords are converted to the new format.
37.Changed List Channels dialog lock password so that a hash is stored
   in mirc.ini instead of the actual password. The old password is
   converted to the new format.
38.Fixed SSL certificate password dialog box bug that, on being
   displayed, caused controls to be enabled even if user was currently
   typing in another window.
39.Added another method for detecting Wine, as a backup to the current
   method.
40.Extended SendMessage() to enable executing a command in the context
   of a remote event. During a remote event, a $eventid identifier is
   set to a unique value to identify the event. This can be passed to a
   DLL which can then pass it back to mIRC using:

   SendMessage(mHwnd, WM_MCOMMAND, MAKEWPARAM(cMethod, cEventId), cIndex)

   This will cause the command/evaluation to execute in the context
   of the remote event identified by cEventId. If cEventId is 0, this
   indicates a non-remote event.
41.Extended SendMessage() to return information about mIRC using
   SendMessage(mHwnd, WM_MCOMMAND, -1, lParam) where lParam is -1 to
   receive the mIRC version number and -2 to receive the cMethod
   options that are supported.
42.Extended SendMessage() to support cMethod value 16 which causes
   SendMessage() to return more useful error values instead of just
   0 for failure and 1 for success. The return values are: 0 = success,
   1 = failure or'd with 2 = bad mapfile name, 4 = bad mapfile size,
   8 = bad eventid, 16 = bad server, 32 = bad script.
43.Fixed hotlinks display bug that affected how hotlinks were displayed
   in dialogs.
44.Fixed topics, modes, and several other events not including the year
   that the mode was set.
45.Changed About dialog to include check for update button.
46.Added installer check for limited user write access to the selected
   install folder when the "portable" option is enabled.
47.Fixed alias/identifier behaviour inconsistency when a recursive call
   is attempted which could have led to unexpected results. Both now
   halt the script with an error message instead.
48.Changed installer to include links to license and privacy policy.
49.Added CAP userhost-in-names support.
50.Changed CAP support so that CAP END will only be sent once the
   server has replied to all requests with ACK or NAK and requests have
   been processed.
51.Fixed timezone/daylight savings bug due to a hack around a bug in a
   previous version of the C runtime library.
52.Fixed all server messages, such as MOTD, not being timestamped when
   timestamp option is enabled.
53.Added CAP server-time and znc.in/server-time[-iso] support. Enabled
   automatically with a CAP request if server lists it in CAP LS. If a
   server message has a @time prefix with a UTC timestamp, $msgstamp
   will return this value.
54.Extended /echo -tN where N is the UTC value you want to use as the
   timestamp.
55.Added support for ircs:// secure links.
56.Improved irc/ircs:// links support in the windows registry by adding
   the following entries: Class\mIRCURL, Software\Clients\IM\mIRC, and
   Software\RegisteredApplications\mIRC.
57.Changed /timer to display seconds in /timers and in $time().delay,
   if seconds are specified on command line.
58.Changed /window -c to not report an error if the non-@window it is
   closing does not exist.
59.Fixed status/channel/query right-click popup menu bug that caused
   clicked target not setting $1 correctly if /remote is off.
60.Fixed an SSL threading bug that may have caused SSL connections to
   crash in some situations.
61.Fixed scripts editor file change monitor bug that may have caused
   some file change notifications to be missed.
62.Changed $ticks so that it uses GetTickCount64() if it is available.
63.Fixed /list command bug that caused the channels list to be saved
   to the wrong filename in the channels folder if you were connected
   to multiple servers.
64.Fixed $read()/play random number bias.
65.Changed $shortfn()/$longfn() to use more reliable method.
66.Fixed $input() display bug with long strings.

26/04/2013 - mIRC v7.31

Changes:
1.Fixed editbox buffer bug that was not storing an edited line if you
  pressed the up key.
2.Fixed incremental search not working correctly in channels list
  window.
3.Changed email catcher to be more strict when determining whether
  something looks like an email address.
4.Fixed installer issue that may been the cause of popups.ini files
  being overwritten in some situations.
5.Added installer command line options /DESKTOP, /NODESKTOP, /STARTMENU
  and /NOSTARTMENU to enable/disable creation of shortcut icons.
6.Added "On Top" menu item to the View menu as users have difficulty
  finding it in the system menu when it is enabled.
7.Changed the "File changed" dialog so that it is closed automatically
  if a load/reload command applies to the same file.
8.Extended $encode/$decode to support blowfish. By default, the method
  is compatible with OpenSSL and uses CBC, key hashing, a random salt
  and PKCS#5 padding. The identifier format is:

    $encode(%var | &binvar, switches, key, [salt | iv])
    $decode(%var | &binvar, switches, key, [salt | iv])

  Where the switches are:

    method: c = cbc or e = ecb encryption (one or the other)
    key: l = literal key (optional, must be 56 characters)
    salt/iv: s = salt or i = iv or r = randomiv (all optional)
    padding: z = zeros, n = one and zeros, p = spaces (all optional)

9.Fixed SSL caching bug that may have required repeat acceptance of
  certficates on some networks. The cache now stores the IP address
  of the associated certificate.
10.Changed connection retry method so that if a connection attempt to
   an SSL server fails, and the server is part of an IP pool, the next
   retry will use the same SSL port.
11.Enabled DPI awareness to prevent Windows applying display scaling to
   mIRC. This should resolve the blurry interface and font issues when
   non-standard DPI display settings are used. A number of GUI-related
   features needed to be updated to cater for this change, eg. fonts
   now use internal defaults of points versus logical sizes. This may
   affect scripts that use dialogs and /draw on systems with non-
   standard DPI settings.
12.Fixed drag-drop bug that may have caused a gpf when switching
   windows between MDI/desktop mode.
13.Added MONITOR protocol support for the notify list. mIRC will use

   connection to the website timed out.
15.Fixed $& indentation bug in scripts editor dialog.

   ISON when the number of nicks in the notify list is within/beyond
   the WATCH/MONITOR limit set by the server.
17.Optimized switchbar and treebar display speed.
18.Fixed switchbar "auto" lines feature being disabled when switchbar
   is repositioned. It is now only disabled if switchbar is resized
   vertically.
19.Fixed timestamp bug that may have caused a gpf in some situations if
   your timestamp was very long.
20.Fixed timestamp part of a message not being wrapped correctly when
   message is initially displayed in a window.
21.Fixed mIRC not handling mouse buttons correctly in some situations
   if the user's system is configured to swap mouse buttons.
22.Changed the way the window buffer is trimmed when it reaches the
   maximum number of lines set in the Options/Other dialog.
23.Added /close -lk to close channels list and links list windows. Note
   that channels list windows cannot be closed if currently listing.
24.Optimized SSL routines.
25.Added SSL identifiers $sslversion, $ssldll and $ssllibdll.
26.Added logging dialog option to enable/disable automatic logging
   of status windows.

  clicking in nicklist area and nicklist is auto-hidden.
6.Fixed /exit -r bug not restarting mIRC when scripts editor dialog is
  open with unsaved files.
7.Updated libraries to zlib 1.2.7.
8.Fixed tips bug that caused tips to flicker briefly in view when the
  "Hide tips when locked" option is enabled and a message is received
  while mIRC is minimized and locked.
9.Fixed editbox buffer bugs that appeared in different contexts, such
  as when combinations of Control+Up/Down were pressed or the editbox
  contained multiple lines entered with the Alt+Enter key.
10.Changed SSL feature to store SSL certificate hashes cache in the
   servers.ini file instead of mirc.ini. Also, hashes are now stored
   for all certificates, good or bad. If a certificate is good but has
   changed since the last connection, a warning is now displayed.
11.Fixed /hotlink bug that prevented hotlink popup menus from being
   displayed.
12.Changed display bitmap cache to check if mIRC has been blocked from
   capturing screen buffer (which can happen with security software).
   If it has, mIRC reverts to slower, non-cache display method.

   is enabled.
14.Fixed script editor bug that caused a freeze when saving popups to a
   non-INI file in certain situations.

  listbox) or calling a command, using the format $hfind(name/N,
  text, N, M, @window | command).

   message in the mIRC titlebar and flash the window's switchbar icon.
14.Fixed /filter -fs bug that prevented matchtext from being applied
   correctly when outputting to the status window.
15.Changed editbox so that it beeps at most ten times when the maximum
   message length is reached. The beep now also respects the "enable
   sounds" option in the sounds dialog.

30/07/2010 - mIRC v7.1

Changes:
1.This is the first stable release of the new Unicode version of mIRC.

  The project to convert mIRC to Unicode has taken almost two years of
  development and testing and has required tens of thousands of changes
  to 150,000+ lines of source code. This has been the most complex and
  time-consuming update to mIRC since it was created in 1995, when it
  started out as a non-Unicode, 16-bit, Windows 3.1 application.

  Many areas of mIRC have had to be updated or re-written, from file
  handling to text processing, from display to memory allocation, from
  server communications to file transfers.

  mIRC should now be faster, more stable, and more compatible with
  the latest versions of Windows, and should be able to better handle
  the display and input of a variety of languages.

  In addition to being converted to Unicode, there are a few other
  notable changes:

  Improved Windows 7 compatibility
  More reliable INI file handling
  Faster text display/scrolling
  Speech support
  Improved interface design for a number of features
  Automatic text color correction
  Menubar Alt key show/hide feature
  Support for italic text and other font styles
  Optimized SSL routines
  Status window SSL connection icon
  IPv6 support
  Improved portable support
  Persistent channel history
  Digitally signed executables
  Automatic splitting of long channel/private messages
  Full screen display with F11 function key
  UPnP support
  Many bug fixes
  And more

  For a full version history of mIRC v7.x development, please see the
  list of changes starting with v7.0.

   in script editor.
12.Added /bwrite -t switch, interprets text value as plain text and
   does not evaluate &binbar variables.

28/05/2010 - mIRC v7.04

Changes:
1.Added UPnP support. The Ports dialog allows you to enable UPnP
  support for retrieving your external IP address, the identd server,
  DCC connections, and the DCC server. The first three options are
  enabled by default.

  mIRC marks UPnP ports that it opens as "mIRC". It closes UPnP ports
  the moment they are no longer needed.

  If mIRC is connecting to multiple servers at the same that use both
  IPv4 and IPv6, the UPnP port for the identd server will only be able
  to handle either IPv4 or IPv6 at any one time, since a UPnP port can
  only be bound to one address.

  If you make any changes to the UPnP options in the Ports dialog, mIRC
  performs a quick check to see if UPnP is available and will warn you
  if it is not.

2.Added /socklisten -p switch to enable UPnP support for a listening
  socket.
3.Changed hotlink feature to handle more formats.
4.Fixed /clear -g switch bug.
5.Optimized display routine to use bitmap caching more efficiently.
6.Changed the way a server connection is closed after sending /quit to
  make disconnection more robust/graceful.
7.Added check for empty servers list. If servers list is empty, mIRC
  looks for the "defaults" folder and copies the servers.ini from
  there to the data folder.

20/05/2010 - mIRC v7.03

Changes:
1.Changed DCC Send/Get windows to show long progress bar when window
  is maximized.
2.Changed DCC Send/Get switchbar buttons to display progress bar in
  black during transfer and grey when finished.
3.Fixed /fseek line matching bugs.
4.Optimized BOM-checking in file routines, should have minimal impact
  on read/write speed now.
5.Fixed $dns().ip bug when resolving an IP address.
6.Changed Control+N back to shortcut for channel switching.
7.Added "Split long channel/query messages" option to Messages dialog.
  If a message is long enough that it might be chopped by the maximum
  server line length, it is sent as mutliple lines.
8.Fixed font bug with reading font settings from mirc.ini.
9.Optimized display routine, should be faster in some situations.
10.Changed richedit editbox support back to riched20.dll since it
   seems to be faster and more reliable overall.
11.Optimized the way scripts are loaded into script editor editbox.
12.Fixed INI file handling bug when reading section/item/data that
   are enclosed in quotes.
13.Fixed hotlink feature not handling single-word hostnames.
14.Changed $utfencode/$utfdecode to return input text if they are
   unable to encode/decode the text instead of returning an error.
15.Changed the way the file routines set end-of-file and error, should
   behave more like older versions now.
16.Added /raw -n switch to prevent characters in the range 0-255 being
   UTF-8 encoded when sent to the server. Also added a $rawbytes
   identifier that returns the incoming server message prior to any
   parsing/decoding.

01/05/2010 - mIRC v7.02

Changes:
1.Added Unicode/UTF-8 BOM support to file routines. This applies to all
  files that are read or written as text, including INI files.
2.Changed DCC Send/Get windows to allow full filename to be viewed when
  window is resized.
3.Changed DCC Get to open download file with exclusive write access.
4.Added support for detecting Wine so that mIRC can use alternative
  code for features that need it. Around fifteen separate workarounds
  were implemented. Features that could not be made to work reliably
  (richedit editbox support and playing mp3 and mid files) are now
  disabled.
5.Changed mouse wheel scroll method in the script editor editbox to
  allow faster/smoother scrolling.
6.Fixed system shell DDE messages bug.
7.Changed font-linking implementation slightly, should be faster and
  support more characters.
8.Added support for /dns $server to fill $serverip for SOCKS5 users,
  though note that this results in a DNS leak.
9.Fixed treebar background update bug.
10.Optimized display routine, should now be faster when displaying
   control codes.
11.Fixed $regml().pos bug.
12.Added Names dialog back to Display options dialog.
13.Fixed /sockudp -k bug.
14.Fixed line colors parsing bug when reloading log files.
15.Fixed query flood check bug.

15/04/2010 - mIRC v7.01

Changes:
1.Changed the way fonts are set for editboxes in windows and in the
  script editor. This should resolve issues for users who are seeing
  the font change when they enter text.
2.Changed the foregound/background color correction feature so that it
  no longer applies if a ^K background color is specified.
3.Fixed /filter gpf bug.
4.Fixed /fopen gpf bug.
5.Changed $input() icons default sound behavior.
6.Fixed text display bug where last character was not entirely visible
  in some situations with certain fonts.

  Unicode character was used in the format string.
9.Changed numeric 451 "You have not registered" message for the "CAP"
  request to no longer be displayed when connecting to a server.
10.Fixed DDE support. Most applications, such as web browsers, can only
   reply to ANSI DDE requests, so mIRC now sends DDE requests in ANSI
   as opposed to Unicode. mIRC can now reply to both Unicode and ANSI
   DDE requests.
11.Changed identd default behavior when choosing userid from email
   address or identd userid field.
12.Fixed $ini()/loadbuf combination bug that was fixing/updating an
   incorrectly formatted INI file even though it was only being read
   by the script.

02/04/2010 - mIRC v7.0

Changes:
1.mIRC is now a Unicode application.
2.mIRC now uses its own custom INI routines to ensure more reliable
  INI file handling. They should work almost identically to the
  standard Windows INI routines.
3.Changed the way microsoft agent is detected by checking for folder
  instead of loading agent to cater for Windows 7 issue.
4.Added a bitmap cache to speed up window text display. Depending on
  the font you are using, your cleartype settings, and/or your cpu
  speed, you should see a significant increase in display speed of text
  in all windows.
5.Fixed script editor not filling as much of the editbox buffer as
  it could (up to maximum size of 500k) when reading a file.
6.Updated to PCRE library v8.02 and enabled Unicode/UTF-8 support.
7.Fixed /drawrot gpf bug.

12.Fix internal http routines not handling redirects correctly.
13.Updated to SAPI5+ speech and voice commands to make them work with
   Windows 7.
14.Added Speech dialog to Sounds dialog. This replaces the Agents dialog
   which is no longer supported by Windows 7. If mIRC notices that
   Agents are available on your version of Windows, the Agents dialog
   option will still be available.
15.Added /speak -spclu [speed] [pitch] [text] command which speaks the
   specified text, where the switches are:

   -s = speed (0 to 100)
   -p = pitch (0 to 100)
   -c = clear all queued lines
   -l = apply lexicon settings in speech dialog.
   -u = apply option settings in speech dialog

   You can use $speak(N) to list all lines that are currently queued
   for speaking through the /speak command. If N = 0, returns total
   number of queued lines.

16.Extended maximum incoming server line length from 600 to 1024
   bytes.
17.Fixed default notify sounds not being saved with relative path.
18.Fixed popup loading bug when a file contains empty lines.
19.Fixed on CLOSE event bug with status window requiring * prefix.
20.Extended on CLOSE event to work with channels.
21.Changed on OPEN/CLOSE events to handle parameters like other
   similar events. This should not affect existing scripts.
22.Added script editor file menu options "Rename" and "Delete".
23.Added [about] portable=[yes|no] item to mirc.ini that allows you
   to enable portable mode more easily on usb drives.
24.Changed mouse wheel routine to correctly handle faster/slower
   scrolling.
25.Added CAP LS protocol support. mIRC now sends "CAP LS" as the first
   line when connecting to a server before sending NICK/USER to logon.
   Currently enables "multi-prefix" and "packet-size=1024" if they are
   available.
26.Fixed listbox item height in Control/Color/Highlight dialogs.
27.Fixed text display being clipped incorrectly when using certain
   fonts.
28.The Channels List window now updates the horizontal scrollbar
   on-the-fly to avoid the display freeze after listing a large number
   of channels.
29.Fixed some controls not being disabled in Lock dialog when lock is
   enabled.
30.When clicking reset button in Colors dialog, colors are now reset
   to the most recent active settings for that theme.
31.mIRC now skips sending "mode +i" on connect if it has already been
   set automatically by the server.
32.Changed the design of some of the dialogs in the Options dialog,
   the DCC Send/Get dialogs, and others.
33.mIRC no longer requires Full Name and Email Address to be filled
   in the connect dialog and sends default values if left empty.
34.On connecting to a server, if both nick and alternative are in use
   mIRC appends a random number to your nickname and tries again.
35.Changed /debug windows to no longer interpret colors. They now
   display control codes as plain text.
36.Changed USER/NICK logon method to comply with RFC2812.
37.Changed switchbar DCC Send/Get button progress bar, now displays a
   small bar under the text.
38.Optimized Unicode font-linking routines.
39.Now using Visual Studio 2008 to compile mIRC.
40.Added WM_PRINTCLIENT support to a number of controls including the
   toolbar, switchbar, and treebar.
41.Renamed "download" folder to "downloads" in line with other folders.
42.Fixed /debug windows log menu not being set correctly.
43.Fixed mIRC main window system menu not being set correctly when
   the menbuar is disabled.
44.Renamed "Firewall" dialog "Proxy". Replaced /firewall command with
   /proxy although /firewall is still supported.
45.mIRC now disables the proxy if it is enabled in the proxy dialog
   but no address is provided and a SOCKS_HOST environment variable
   does not exist.
46.Added menbuar auto-show/hide feature that displays the menubar
   when you press the Alt key and hides it afterwards.
47.Keyboard focus now automatically switches to the treebar if all
   other windows are minimized.
48.Fixed PCRE gpf bug when expression results in heavy recursion.
49.Changed switchbar to display transparent buttons when a background
   picture is selected.
50.Added support for all available font styles, such as italic and
   semi-bold, in font dialog.
51.Added support for Control+I key combination to make italic text
   using control code 29.
52.Added support for DLLs that use Unicode functions. By default mIRC
   assumes that DLL functions are ANSI for backwards compatibility.
   However a DLL can enable Unicode support by setting mUnicode to
   TRUE in the LOADINFO structure:

   typedef struct {
     DWORD  mVersion;
     HWND   mHwnd;
     BOOL   mKeep;
     BOOL   mUnicode;
   } LOADINFO;

53.Added SendMessage WM_MEVALUATE/WM_MCOMMAND support for Unicode.
   By default mIRC assumes that mapped file data is ANSI for backwards
   compatibility. However an application can "or" the value 8 in the
   cMethod parameter to specify Unicode data.
54.Changed display behavior for a number of dialogs, such as the DCC
   Send/Get dialogs, so that buttons are now disabled for a short time
   when the dialogs are displayed to prevent accidental typing. If the
   user is typing, the buttons remain disabled until the user stops.

   Added a 'b' switch to $input() and an "option disable" property to
   custom dialogs that enables this behavior.

55.Fixed treebar display bug when displaying DCC window names.
56.Changed script editor Order dialog to automatically select the
   active script in the listbox on opening.
57.Updated editbox in all windows and script editor to use richedit 4.1
   msftedit.dll for improved Unicode support. If not available reverts
   to riched20.dll.
58.Changed line numbering method in script editor, uses more reliable
   method that is independent of editbox.
59.Changed status window icon to display a yellow lock when on a secure
   connection using SSL.
60.Fixed Control+K color dialog centering bug.
61.Changed servers list sorting method so that the networks listed in
   the [networks] section of servers.ini are now placed at the top.
62.Changed DCC Send/Get transfer windows default font, now uses the
   system dialog font. Also switched to appropriate system font for
   measurements in features such as $input() and popup menus.
63.Changed design of DCC Send/Get transfer windows, interface is now
   clearer and the display updates once a second.
64.Changed flood protection to begin working only after receiving the
   first numeric to prevent logon issues in some situations.
65.Changed design of the File Type warning dialog, now clearer and also
   shows the file extension that was ignored.
66.Optimized the way line indentation works, such as for /echo -iN,
   and other displayed lines.
67.Improved tab and indent spacing measurement method for both fixed
   and non-fixed width fonts.
68.Improved text-wrapping at whole word boundaries, and now wraps at
   both spaces and commas.
69.Numeric 422 "MOTD file is missing" message is no longer displayed
   when first connecting to a server.
70.Fixed proxy errors not being displayed correctly in some situations.
71.Added a bind listbox to the Connect/Options/Ports dialog that lists
   all active networks interfaces for easy selection. It still allows
   you to enter an IP address as well.
72.Updated /dns command, now multi-threaded, resolves concurrently,
   and can return both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. By default, /dns only
   returns IPv4. You can use the switches -46 to return a combination
   of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
73.Added support for IPv6 connections. By default, mIRC will always use
   IPv4, so IPv6 support must be explicitly enabled using one of these
   methods:

   1) Enable IPv6 support in the Connect/Options/Ports dialog. This
   allows mixed IPv4 and IPv6 connections, with IPv6 taking priority
   in DNS resolution. This means that if you try to connect to a server
   that has both IPv6 and IPv4 addresses, mIRC will try IPv6 first.

   2) The bind option in the Connect/Options/Ports dialog. If you
   specify an IPv4 or IPv6 adapter/address, DNS resolution and all
   connections will be made based on the adapter/address type. If you
   explicitly specify an IP address for a connection, such as a /server
   or DCC connection, it overrides this setting.

   3) The /server command with switches -46 to force DNS resolution
   to return either IPv4, IPv6, or both. If you specify an IP address,
   it overrides the switches. The server window will use the requested
   DNS method for all subsequent connections until you change it with
   the /server command.

   Note: in order to use IPv6, both your version of Windows and your
   Internet connection must support IPv6.

74.Added $iptype(text) identifier, returns "ipv4" or "ipv6" if text is
   is a valid IP address format. With IPv6 addresses, the properties
   .compress and .expand can be used.
75.Added cue text (optional) to Connect dialog for user name and email
   address.
76.Extended $portfree(port,ip) so that you can specify an ip address.
   If not specified, all active interfaces are checked as before. An
   adapter name can also be used instead of an ip address.
77.Added $bindip(N|ip) identifier. If N is specified, lists active
   network adapters with properties .name, .ip, .loopback. If an ip
   address is specified, returns best adapter for connecting to that
   ip address.
78.Updated to OpenSSL 0.9.8n library.
79.Updated installer to offer a portable install option that can be
   used to run mIRC on a USB flash drive.
80.Added support for whois numeric 729.
81.Added "Invalid certificate" disconnect message in the event of an
   SSL connection failing due to an invalid certificate. If there is a
   DNS pool, mIRC will now continue to retry the connection.
82.Changed /localinfo to report an error if you try to use an invalid
   switch. Also fixed /localinfo not setting/saving the local info
   results correctly across server windows.
83.Fixed hotlink shift-key display bug.
84.Fixed logfile bug when window is switched between MDI/desktop.
85.Added $file().sig property, checks digital signature of a file.
86.Added check for foreground/background colors in control codes in
   text. If they are the same, the foreground color is changed to
   ensure the text is visible.

   default schemes are added back to the list.
88.Changed position of history menu in file and favorites menus.
89.Added /close -t switch, closes all status windows. If used with -i
   switch, closes only if not connected/connecting to a server.
90.Channels history is now saved across sessions to the [chanhist]
   section in mirc.ini.
91.Fixed tips display bug that caused tip width to be smaller than
   necessary, shortening the title text.

   message in some cases when a certificate error was detected.
93.Fixed /var gpf bug.
