# AvalonScript
AvalonScript is a mIRC-based client that includes very specific functions for the purpose of making RP — roleplay, easier.

## What is AvalonScript?

AvalonScript was created mostly so that I had an easier time in role-playing on DarkMyst and other networks. Several of our players in #Lysharia_OOC have told me that I should make AvalonScript available to people that wants to use this script, after they learned what AvalonScript could do. After some serious thinking on my part, I realized this was a good idea, as it also allows me to easily let people know when a new release has came out for AvalonScript. And thus... AvalonScript was born.

**Features**

1. AvalonScript integrates the well-known Voodoo² script from VoodooScript, with the script working fully in every way. If you've had previous mIRC scripting experience and had trouble getting Voodoo to work for you, it may be a result of clashing scripts. That's not an issue here in AvalonScript! (Site seems to be down, though...)
2. A highlight manager that enables you to keep track of highlights across multiple networks in one handy window!
3. An auto-ident, ghost, join script that works across multiple networks. This allows you to configure mIRC to automatically identify yourself and join various channels as soon as you start mIRC and tell it to connect to your usual servers.
4. A lag-bar system that helps you keep track of lag across multiple networks. Handy for when you're not sure if your posts are going through slowly, or if posts are coming through slowly for whatever reason.
5. A DarkEngine script that helps you barf out your computer's specifications if someone's trying to help you fix your computer, or if you just want to brag that you've got an awesome computer.
6. A custom theme that I've written for AvalonScript. It is editable for those who are familiar with mIRC scripting.
7. PM manager engine has been added, for those who would prefer not to deal with PMs from people that they do not wish to speak to.

More features to come as I receive requests!

_______________________________________________<br>
[¤ v0.3 Changes: ¤]<br>
[¤ Added PM blocker. The controls for that can be found by typing /querycontrol in any message box. ¤]<br>
[¤ Minor bug-fixes here and there again. ¤]<br>
[¤ Added some quotes from #Lysharia. ¤]<br>
_______________________________________________<br>
[¤ v0.2 Changes: ¤]<br>
[¤ Added auto-ident/ghost script. ¤]<br>
[¤ Added dice script. Unfortunately the dice script has been found to not be useful so I've taken out the code for it but left this bit here so I do not need to readd it again later once I've gotten a stable version running in my dev copy. ¤]<br>
[¤ Replaced image placeholders stolen from Ghalerion 4.0 with own images for AvalonScript. ¤]<br>
_______________________________________________<br>
[¤ v0.1 Changes: ¤]<br>
[¤ Added nick-coloring to messages posted in channel. This helps to differentiate the nicks in channel if you occasionally get lost in loads of people posting as commonly seen in role-playing channels. ¤]<br>
[¤ SSL is enabled in mIRC. You will need to have the Visual C++ 2008 Redistributables installed for SSL to work properly. Site is at: http://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html Addendum: 64-bit SSL does NOT work at this time. ¤]<br>
[¤ To connect to SSL-enabled servers use the :+portnumber suffix in order to connect to a server via SSL. For example to connect to DarkMyst's SSL-enabled servers you'd type /server irc.darkmyst.org:+6697 ¤]<br>
[¤ Integrated Voodoo script ¤]<br>
[¤ Integrated highlighter. This script automatically opens a window allowing you to see who highlighted you and when. Even better it shows which network and channel as well! Note: Window doesn't open until someone highlights your current name. ¤]<br>
[¤ Integrated DarkEngine script. Hate not being able to tell others what your computer's specs are? This is the fix! ¤]<br>
[¤ Note: When using the DarkEngine script it's best to set your internet connection when it asks you. It will cause mIRC to crash but from that point on it shouldn't have issues. ¤]<br>
[¤ Wrote theme for script. ¤]<br>
[¤ Stole image crap from Ghalerion 4.0 as placeholder until I can create my own images. ¤]<br>
[¤ Stole the start-up script from Ghalerion 4.0. Will also eventually replace the quotes seen during start-up. ¤]

## Getting AvalonScript

For the purpose of this guide, I will assume that you know how to download and unzip zipped packages, such as the one I use for AvalonScript.

Now, let's get started and download AvalonScript.

[AvalonScript](https://dropbox.com/s/9lu73pqjj1x4sht/AvalonScript.zip) is the most current version of **AvalonScript**. We are working on moving AvalonScript to Github.

Extract it to wherever you wanted to place it. Finally, run AvalonScript by launching mirc.exe and customize to your liking.

**Note: Do not extract this over your default mIRC install! If you ignore this warning, it is entirely _your_ fault!**
