1. Install
===============
	Make sure you unload any old versions of this script before loading the new one!
	( /unload -rs ircify.mrc )

    Note: This script may not work properly on mIRC versions older than 6.30. Use the latest mIRC to be sure.

	To install the script please copy ALL THE FILES IN THE ZIP to your 
	mirc script folder ( //echo -a $scriptdir ) and load the script with /load -rs ircify.mrc

	Overwrite the existing files if you have an old version installed!
	If you can not overwrite the dll, close mirc and retry.
	
	If the script does not work, or mirc says that the dll can't be loaded
	Download & install this: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5555



2. Usage
===============
	To use the script you can either use /sptell in a channel
	or you can use the popupmenu (ircify->Show NP) 
	Or you can press F11 (the default hotkey) in any channel to show the info as well.
	
	The settings dialog is avalable by typing /ircify or in the popup menu.

	For scripters and advanced users there is more info on how to customize the script in the script header.
